0,"The shards of Narsil...the blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand. Boromir picks up the sword and gently touches the Blade. Close on: a small bloom of blood appears on Boromir's finger... So it is true! It is a gift...a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held the forces of Mordor at bay...by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy...let us use it against him! And what would a ranger know of this matter? Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir? Gondor needs no king. One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly. And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his? You carry the fate of us all, little one. Get away from the blade, Pippin...on your toes...good, very good...I want you to react, not think. Move your feet. It's moving fast...against the wind. Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover! WIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cover It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing...such a little thing. As you wish. I care not. We must get off the mountain! Make for the gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city. This is no mine...it's a tomb! We make for the Gap of Rohan.    We should never have come here. Legolas! They have a cave troll! What is this new devilry? Give them a moment...for pity's sake! I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head...she spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor, and she said to me: ""Even now, there One day our paths will lead us there, and the tower guards shall take up the call ""the Lords of Gondor have returned."" None of us should wander alone; you least of all. So much depends on you...Frodo? Warning?   Against what? I ask only for the strength to defend my people. (angrily drops the wood he has If you would but lend me the ring... Why do you recoil?   I am no thief. What chance do you think you have? They will find you, they will take the ring and you will beg for death before the end. I see your mind...you will take the ring to Sauron. You will betray us! You go to your death and the death of us all. Run!   Run! They took the little ones... Then you did what I could not.   I tried to take the ring from him. Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed you all. Leave it! It is over...the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin..Aragorn.. Our people...our people... "
