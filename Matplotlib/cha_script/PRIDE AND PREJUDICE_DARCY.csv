0,Thank you. It is the work of many
1,generations.
2,Not if I can help it.
3,"Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as"
4,they over hear the following...
5,You know how I detest it.
6,You are dancing with the only handsome
7,girl in the room.
8,"Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not"
9,handsome enough to tempt me.
10,Elizabeth's smile drops.
11,I thought that poetry was the food of
12,love.
13,"So what do you recommend, to encourage"
14,affection?
15,I think her concern for her sister does
16,her credit.
17,"A little pause, Caroline recovers."
18,• You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
19,"Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly."
20,"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to"
21,my lot instead of yours.
22,"I have already told her once, by your"
23,desire.
24,Lizzie looks across from her book.
25,The word is indeed applied too liberally.
26,I cannot boast of knowing more than half
27,"a dozen women, in all my acquaintance,"
28,that are truely accomplished.
29,I do.
30,And of course she must improve her mind
31,by extensive reading.
32,Elizabeth closes her book.
33,Are you so severe on your own sex?
34,"You can only have two motives, Miss"
35,"Bingley, and I would interfere with"
36,either.
37,Either you are in each other's confidence
38,"and have secret affairs to discuss, or"
39,you are conscious that your figures
40,appear to the greatest advantage by
41,"walking. If the first, I should get in"
42,"your way. If the second, I can admire you"
43,• much better from here.
44,That I couldn't say.
45,Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive
46,"the follies and vices of others, or their"
47,"offences against myself. My good opinion,"
48,"once lost, is lost forever."
49,I find it perfectly adequate even if
50,society is a little less varied than in
51,town.
52,Miss Bennet.
53,They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the
54,Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley
55,waves enthusiastically to Jane.
56,"May I have the next dance, Miss"
57,Elizabeth.
58,Elizabeth is stunned.
59,Indeed. Most invigorating.
60,"They continue, for a moment, in silence."
61,"I am perfectly happy to oblige, please"
62,advise me of what you would like most to
63,• hear.
64,Do you talk as a rule while dancing?
65,I see no striking resemblance of your own
66,"character in this, how near it is to mine"
67,your sisters very often walk to Meryton?
68,I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed
69,with such happy manners as may ensure his
70,making friends - whether he is capable of
71,retaining them is less certain.
72,I am. May I ask to what these questions
73,tend.
74,And what have you discovered?
75,I hope to afford you more clarity in the
76,• future.
77,"I trust your family is in good health,"
78,Miss Bennet?
79,She plays very well.
80,"I am well enough acquainted with you,"
81,"Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you"
82,even should I wish it.
83,A beat. They eye each other warily. Colonel Fitzwilliam
84,joins them.
85,I do not have the talent of conversing
86,easily with people I have never met
87,before.
88,This is a charming house. I believe my
89,aunt did a great deal to it when Mr
90,Collins first arrived.
91,Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his
92,choice of wife.
93,No. Thankyou.
94,"The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up."
95,"Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a"
96,pleasure.
97,"He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused"
98,and intrigued.
99,"Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but"
100,I can bear it no longer ... . The past
101,months have been a torment...
102,"He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in"
103,astonishment. He struggles on.
104,I came to Rosings with the single object
105,of seeing you...I had to see you...
106,"• I've fought against my better judgement,"
107,my family's expectation...
108,Please do me the honour of accepting my
109,hand.
110,A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful
111,confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.
112,Are you laughing at me?
113,Are you rejecting me?
114,"Might I ask why, with so little endeavour"
115,"at civility, I am thus repulsed?"
116,"Believe me, I didn't mean -"
117,What reasons?
118,I do not deny it.
119,Because I believed your sister
120,indifferent to him.
121,"• I watched them most carefully, and"
122,realized his attachment was much deeper
123,than hers.
124,"Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded"
125,that she didn't feel strongly for him.
126,I did it for his own good.
127,It was made perfectly clear that-an
128,advantageous marriage...
129,"There was, however, I have to admit..."
130,the matter of your family -
131,"No, it was more than that."
132,"It pains me to say this, but it was the"
133,"lack of propriety shown by your mother,"
134,"your three younger sisters - even, on"
135,"occasion, your father. Forgive me."
136,Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.
137,You and your sister -- I must exclude from
138,this...
139,Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth
140,"glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery."
141,Mr Wickham?
142,You take an eager interest in that
143,gentleman's concerns!
144,"Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very"
145,great indeed!
146,So this is your opinion of me! Thank you
147,for explaining so fully. Perhaps these
148,"offences might have been overlooked, if"
149,your pride had not been hurt -
150,- by my honesty in admitting scruples
151,about our relationship.
152,"Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much"
153,of your time.
154,"He leaves, abruptly."
155,"Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What"
156,has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears.
157,I came to leave you this.
158,He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth
159,does not turn but watches him through the mirror.
160,Miss Bennet!
161,"Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches"
162,"up with her. They both blush, deeply."
163,And are you having a pleasant trip?
164,• Tomorrow?
165,May I see you to the village?
166,Yes.
167,- I shall send my carriage at noon
168,After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the
169,table.
170,"My sister, Miss Darcy..."
171,"They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl."
172,• Yes I should.
173,"She's easily persuaded, is she not?"
174,They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley
175,approaches.
176,"Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear."
177,Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this
178,afternoon?
179,I perceive no alteration' except she is
180,rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous
181,consequence of travelling in the summer.
182,"You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even"
183,"had I thought it, I would have couched it"
184,I have recently thought a great deal
185,about how I appear and act to others.
186,Miss Elizabeth.
187,She cries on.
188,This is my fault - if only I had exposed
189,Wickham when I should.
190,Would to heaven that anything could be
191,said or done on my part that could offer
192,consolation to such distress.
193,I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed.
194,I will leave you. Goodbye.
195,"Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and"
196,then is gone.
197,I have some business with Mr Bingley.
198,Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes
199,slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor
200,window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and
201,bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley
202,looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We
203,witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has
204,wronged Jane Bennet.
205,"Quite well, thank you."
206,I return to town tomorrow.
207,What were you thinking of?
208,It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and
209,down.
210,What are you doing out here so early?
211,Me neither. I have been up.most of the
212,night.
213,I am alarmed that you know of what I have
214,been so in earnest to keep silent. But
215,you must know that your happiness was one
216,of my prime inducements.
217,Elizabeth looks at Darcy.
218,"Allow me, Mrs Darcy."
219,He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the
220,"rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by"
221,"side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley."
222,"I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or"
223,"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."
