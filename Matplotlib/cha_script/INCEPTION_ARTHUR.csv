0,What Mr. Cobb is trying to say-
1,"Yes. In the dream state, conscious"
2,defenses are lowered and your
3,thoughts become vulnerable to
4,theft. It's called extraction.
5,He knows.
6,What's going on up there?
7,Saito knows. He's playing with us.
8,"What's she doing here, Cobb?"
9,See that you do. We're here to
10,work.
11,I know! We have to reconnect the
12,loop before they wake up!
13,I'm not going to make it! Wake
14,Cobb!
15,Dunk him!
16,"They're getting closer, Cobb."
17,"Come on, Cobb."
18,Not good.
19,How could you get the carpet
20,wrong?!
21,You're the architect-
22,And you-what the hell was all that?
23,I'd hate to see out of control-
24,Why? He's not gonna search every
25,compartment.
26,I can keep him under for one minute-
27,Our ride's on the roof.
28,Cobb... are you okay?
29,Down in the dream... Mal showing up
30,like that ...
31,"It's getting worse, isn't it?"
32,Hasn't shown. Wanna wait?
33,Where will you go?
34,Stateside.
35,Of course not.
36,"Okay, here's planting an idea: I"
37,"say to you, ""Don't think about"
38,"elephants."""
39,What are you thinking about?
40,Right. But it's not your idea
41,because you know I gave it to you.
42,The subject's mind can always trace
43,the genesis of the idea. True
44,inspiration is impossible to fake.
45,"Cobb, come on-"
46,"Cobb, we should walk away from"
47,this.
48,I know how much you want to go home-
49,But this can't be done.
50,You don't know that!-
51,Did it work?
52,Who did you do it to?
53,So why are we headed to Paris?
54,That's why the military developed
55,dream sharing-a training program
56,"where soldiers could strangle, stab"
57,"and shoot each other, then wake up."
58,Five minutes in the real world
59,gives you an hour in the dream.
60,It's okay.
61,The only way to wake from inside
62,the dream is to die.
63,Some kind of personal icon. A small
64,object that you can always have
65,"with you, and that no one else"
66,"knows,"
67,Sounds like you've met Mrs. Cobb.
68,So. A totem. You need something
69,"small, potentially heavy..."
70,Too common. You need something that
71,has a weight or movement that only
72,you know.
73,A loaded die.
74,I can't let you handle it. That's
75,the point. No one else can know the
76,weight or balance of it.
77,So when you examine your totem...
78,Why not?
79,Where will you be?
80,Eames? But he's in Mombasa. Cobol's
81,backyard.
82,There are plenty of other thieves.
83,He said you'd be back.
84,But there's nothing else quite like
85,it.
86,Shall we take a look at paradoxical
87,architecture?
88,You're going to have to master a
89,few tricks if you're going to build
90,three complete dream levels.
91,"In a dream, you can cheat"
92,architecture into impossible
93,shapes.
94,"That lets you create closed loops,"
95,like the Penrose Steps. The
96,infinite staircase.
97,See...
98,Paradox. A closed loop like this
99,helps you disguise the boundaries
100,of the dream you've created.
101,Anything from the floor of a
102,"building, to an entire city. But it"
103,has to be complicated enough for us
104,to hide from the projections.
105,And the better the maze-
106,"You wait, they'll turn ugly. No one"
107,likes to see someone else messing
108,around in their mind.
109,"I don't know if he can't, but he"
110,won't. He thinks it's safer if he
111,doesn't know the layouts.
112,He won't tell me. I think it's Mal.
113,I think she's getting stronger.
114,She's not his ex.
115,"No. No, she's dead, Ariadne. What"
116,you see in there is just his
117,projection of her.
118,She was lovely.
119,How deep?
120,A dream within a dream within a
121,dream? Is that even possible?
122,How do you translate a business
123,strategy into an emotion?
124,Might? We'll have to do better than
125,that.
126,Forgive me for wanting a little
127,"specificity, Eames."
128,How do you produce these emotional
129,triggers?
130,Are those yours?
131,Yusuf?
132,So he gives himself the idea.
133,"Eames, I'm impressed."
134,It'd have to be a 747.
135,"On a 747 the pilots are up above,"
136,first class is in the nose so
137,nobody walks through the cabin.
138,We'd have to buyout the whole
139,"cabin, and the first class flight"
140,attendant-
141,My question is how we go down three
142,layers with enough stability. Three
143,layers down a little turbulence is
144,gonna translate into an earthquake.
145,The dreams are gonna collapse with
146,the slightest disturbance.
147,How do we get out once we've made
148,the plant?
149,I hope you've got something a
150,little more elegant in mind than
151,shooting me in the head like last
152,time.
153,But how are we going to feel that
154,through the sedation?
155,Even that won't cut through three
156,layers of deep sleep.
157,We can use the musical countdown to
158,synchronize the different kicks.
159,Couldn't you have peed before you
160,went under?
161,Everybody okay? Saito?
162,I don't know. What happened back
163,there? Where were you?
164,Why would you put a train crossing
165,in a downtown intersection?
166,Fischer's had an extractor teach
167,his mind to defend itself. His
168,subconscious is militarized. It
169,should've shown on the research-
170,Calm down.
171,"Cobb, we've dealt with sub-security"
172,before. We just have to be more-
173,Unconstructed dream space.
174,"Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing"
175,there but what was left behind by
176,anyone on the team who's been trapped
177,there before. On this team... just
178,Cobb.
179,Let's just get him upstairs.
180,Hold this. Firm pressure.
181,You knew the risks and you didn't
182,tell us.
183,You had no right.
184,And you. You went along with this?
185,You trusted him? When? When he
186,promised you half his share?
187,"Oh, yeah? With Mal? That worked out"
188,"great, didn't it, Cobb?"
189,"In. your lather's office, below the"
190,"bookshelves, is his personal safe."
191,We need the combination.
192,We have it on good authority that
193,you do.
194,Good authority.
195,The combination.
196,Why would Browning tell us you did?
197,That helps us?
198,But how do you reconcile them if
199,they're that estranged?
200,"Well, work fast-Fischer's"
201,"projections are closing in quick,"
202,we need to break out of here before
203,we're totally boxed in...
204,What about his security? It's going
205,to get worse as we go deeper.
206,No.
207,A bad idea.
208,Sure. But it didn't work. The
209,subject realized he was dreaming
210,and his subconscious tore us to
211,pieces.
212,And don't make the jump too soon-
213,"that kick is our only way back, we"
214,have to be ready to catch it-
215,And there goes Mr. Charles.
216,It's a gambit designed to turn
217,Fischer against his own
218,subconscious.
219,Because it involves telling the
220,mark that he's dreaming. Which
221,involves attracting a lot of
222,attention to us.
223,You must've noticed by now how much
224,time Cobb spends doing things he
225,says never to do.
226,Cobb's drawing Fischer's attention
227,to the strangeness of the dream.
228,That's making his subconscious look
229,for the dreamer. For me.
230,"So, if everything's correct, this"
231,room should be directly below 528.
232,"No, I have to judge it myself. Once"
233,"you're all asleep up in room 528, I"
234,wait `til Yusuf starts his kick...
235,"His music warns me it's coming,"
236,then the van hitting the barrier of
237,the bridge should be unmistakable-
238,that's when I blow the floor out
239,from underneath us and we get a
240,"nice synchronized kick. Too soon,"
241,and we won't get pulled out; too
242,late and I won't be able to drop
243,us.
244,The van will be in free fall. I
245,can't drop us with no gravity.
246,Mr. Charles!
247,Shhhh!
248,He's out.
249,He's going to help us break into
250,his own subconscious.
251,I'll lead them on a merry chase.
252,I'm on it.
253,Hey!
254,"No, Yusuf. Too soon!"
255,Paradox.
256,How the hell do I drop you?
257,What happened?
258,With Mal?
259,He'll be lost...
