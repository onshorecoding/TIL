0,Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.
1,You want a chocolate?
2,I could eat about a million and a 
3,"half of these. My momma always said, "
4,"""Life was like a box of chocolates."
5,You never know what you're gonna 
6,"get."""
7,Those must be comfortable shoes. 
8,I'll bet you could walk all day in 
9,shoes like that and not feel a thing. 
10,I wish I had shoes like that.
11,Momma always says there's an awful 
12,lot you could tell about a person by 
13,their shoes. Where they're going.
14,Where they've been.
15,I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I 
16,think about it real hard I could 
17,remember my first pair of shoes.
18,Momma said they'd take my anywhere.
19,"Momma, what's vacation mean?"
20,Where Daddy went?
21,"Must be hard being a king. You know, "
22,it's funny how you remember some 
23,"things, but some things you can't."
24,"I sure will, Momma."
25,Momma said not to be taking rides 
26,from strangers.
27,I'm Forrest Gump.
28,"Well, now we ain't strangers anymore."
29,"Um, nothing at all, thank you. My "
30,legs are just fine and dandy.
31,My momma said my back's crooked like 
32,a question mark. These are going to 
33,make me as straight as an arrow.
34,They're my magic shoes.
35,Mommy says stupid is as stupid does.
36,I'm Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump.
37,"""...a good little monkey and..."""
38,Momma's gonna worry about me.
39,"Okay, Jenny. I'll stay."
40,My only friend.
41,"Now, my Momma always told me that "
42,miracles happen every day. Some people 
43,"don't think so, but they do."
44,But I can run like the wind blows.
45,"From that day on, if I was going "
46,"somewhere, I was running!"
47,Jenny? Jenny?
48,"Jenny, why didn't you come to school "
49,today?
50,"Now, it used to be, I ran to get "
51,where I was goin'. I never thought 
52,it would take me anywhere.
53,"Earl, what's going on?"
54,Coons? When raccoons try to get on 
55,"our back porch, Momma just chase 'em "
56,off with a broom.
57,With us? They do?
58,"Ma'am, you dropped your book. Ma'am."
59,But he didn't die.
60,Is it the number 9?
61,It was nice talkin' to you.
62,"Did you go to a girls' college, or "
63,to a girls' and boys' together 
64,college?
65,'Cause Jenny went to a college I 
66,couldn't go to. It was a college 
67,just for girls.
68,He was hurtin' you.
69,I brought you some chocolates. I'm 
70,sorry. I'll go back to my college 
71,now.
72,Is this your room?
73,Who I'm gonna be?
74,Aren't I going to be me?
75,I sit next to them in my home 
76,economics class all the time.
77,Ohh... Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.
78,"Oh, I'm dizzy."
79,No.
80,I think I ruined your roommate's 
81,bathrobe.
82,I gotta pee.
83,And a few years after that...
84,It must be hard being brothers. I 
85,wouldn't know.
86,Thought?
87,...Forrest Gump.
88,"No, but I been on a real big boat."
89,My name's Forrest Gump. People call 
90,me Forrest Gump.
91,Okay.
92,"To do whatever you tell me, Drill "
93,Sergeant!
94,"Done, Drill Sergeant!"
95,"You told me to, Drill Sergeant."
96,Come on.
97,They was tryin' to grab you.
98,I can't help it. I love you.
99,"Yes, I do."
100,"What do you mean, Jenny?"
101,But wait. Jenny!
102,"So bye-bye, Jenny. They sendin' me "
103,to Vietnam. It's this whole other 
104,country.
105,"Okay. Jenny, I'll write you all the "
106,time.
107,"Morning', sir!"
108,"Alabama, sir!"
109,"No, we are not relations, sir."
110,I sure hope I don't let him down.
111,Hey Bubba...
112,Okay.
113,That's a fine idea.
114,Bubba!
115,Bubba?
116,Tex!
117,Okay.
118,"Lieutenant Dan, Coleman's dead!"
119,"Ah, something bit me!"
120,To get Bubba.
121,I gotta find Bubba!
122,Bubba...
123,"Oh, Bubba, no..."
124,Come on. Come on. Come here...
125,"Hey, Bubba..."
126,You got shot.
127,That's all I have to say about that.
128,A bullet?
129,"Oh, yes sir. Bit me directly in the "
130,buttocks. They said it was a million 
131,"dollar wound, but the Army must keep "
132,"that money, 'cause I still ain't "
133,seen a nickel of that million dollars.
134,The only good thing about being 
135,wounded in the buttocks...
136,"Lieutenant Dan, I got you some ice "
137,"cream. Lieutenant Dan, ice cream."
138,I'm Forrest Gump.
139,"Well... Yes, sir, I do."
140,Yo-You're still Lieutenant Dan.
141,"Yes, sir!"
142,"Guess what, Lieutenant Dan, they "
143,want to give me a me...
144,"Ma'am, what'd they do with Lieutenant "
145,Dan?
146,"In the buttocks, sir."
147,Okay.
148,The war in Vietnam?
149,Well...
150,...there was only one thing I could 
151,say about the war in Vietnam.
152,In Vietnam war...
153,...and that's all I have to say about 
154,that.
155,My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest 
156,Gump.
157,Jenny!
158,"He should not be hitting you, Jenny."
159,Sorry I had a fight in the middle of 
160,your Black Panther party.
161,"I would never hurt you, Jenny."
162,I wanted to be your boyfriend.
163,You know what?
164,I'm glad we were here together in 
165,our national capitol.
166,"I wish you wouldn't go, Jenny."
167,You know what I think? I think you 
168,should go home to Greenbow. Alabama!
169,I want you to have this.
170,I got it just by doing what you told 
171,me to do.
172,You're my girl.
173,...ping-pong. I was so good that 
174,some years later...
175,...I was national celebrity. Famouser 
176,even than Captain Kangaroo.
177,"Well, in the land of China, people "
178,hardly got nothing at all.
179,"And in China, they never go to church."
180,Now that's Lieutenant Dan. Lieutenant 
181,Dan!
182,"Yes sir, they sure did."
183,"Yes, sir."
184,Lieutenant Dan!
185,"What are you doing here in New York, "
186,Lieutenant Dan?
187,I didn't know I was supposed to be 
188,"looking for him, sir."
189,"I'm going to heaven, Lieutenant Dan."
190,"Yes, sir."
191,Shrimpin' boats.
192,I gotta buy me one of them shrimpin' 
193,boats as soon as I have some money.
194,I made me a promise to Bubba in 
195,"Vietnam, that as soon as the war was "
196,"over, we'd go in partners. He'd be "
197,the captain of the shrimpin' boat 
198,and I'd be his first mate. But now 
199,"that he's dead, that means that I "
200,gotta be the captain.
201,"Yes, sir. A promise is a promise, "
202,Lieutenant Dan.
203,Okay.
204,"My name is Forrest, Forrest Gump."
205,"Happy New Year, Lieutenant Dan!"
206,I'm sorry I ruined your New Year's 
207,"Eve party, Lieutenant Dan. She tastes "
208,like cigarettes.
209,...a few months later they invited 
210,me and the ping-pong team to visit 
211,the White House. So I went again.
212,And I met the President of the United 
213,States again.
214,"Yes, sir."
215,It's called the Hotel Ebbott.
216,"Yeah, sir, you might want to send a "
217,maintenance man over to that office 
218,"across the way. The lights are off, "
219,and they must be looking for the 
220,"fuse box or something, 'cause them "
221,"flashlights they're, they're keeping "
222,me awake.
223,Thank you.
224,Good night.
225,"Yes, sir!"
226,Does this mean I can't play ping 
227,pong no more?
228,"I'm home, Momma."
229,"Oh, Momma. I only like using my own "
230,"paddle. Hi, Miss Louise."
231,"Stupid is as stupid does, Mrs. Blue."
232,"Hey, Bubba, it's me, Forrest Gump. I "
233,"remember everything you said, and I "
234,got it all figured out.
235,"I'm taking the twenty-four thousand, "
236,five hundred and six-two dollars and 
237,forty-seven cents that I got...
238,"Stupid is as stupid does, sir."
239,"Well, that's what's left after me "
240,"saying, ""When I was in China on the "
241,"All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just"
242,loved playing ping-pong with my Flex-
243,"O-Ping-Pong Paddle."" Which everybody "
244,"knows it isn't true, but Momma says "
245,it's just a little white lie so it 
246,"wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway, "
247,"I'm putting all that on gas, ropes "
248,and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' 
249,boat.
250,I only caught five.
251,Hi!
252,"Lieutenant Dan, what are you doing "
253,here?
254,"Well, you ain't got no legs, "
255,Lieutenant Dan.
256,Okay.
257,"No, sir."
258,That's my boat.
259,Which way?
260,Okay.
261,"Still no shrimp, Lieutenant Dan."
262,"Well, how we gonna find them?"
263,No shrimp.
264,...and we were the only boat left 
265,"standing ""Bubba-Gump"" shrimp's what "
266,they got. We got a whole bunch of 
267,"boats. Twelve Jenny's, a big ol' "
268,"warehouse, we even have hats that"
269,"says ""Bubba-Gump"" on 'em. ""Bubba-"
270,"Gump Shrimp."" It's a household name."
271,"Yes, sir. We've got more money than "
272,Davy Crocket.
273,Would you like to see what Lieutenant 
274,Dan looks like?
275,That's him right there.
276,And let me tell you something about 
277,Lieutenant Dan.
278,Where's Momma?
279,"What's the matter, Momma?"
280,"Why are you dyin', Momma?"
281,"You did good, Momma."
282,"What's my destiny, Momma?"
283,And that's all I have to say about 
284,that.
285,Didn't you say you were waiting for 
286,the Number Seven bus?
287,"Now, because I had been a football "
288,"star, and a war hero, and a national "
289,"celebrity, and a shrimpin' boat "
290,"captain, and a college graduate, the "
291,"city of fathers of Greenbow, Alabama, "
292,decided to get together and offered 
293,me a fine job.
294,"And I said, ""That's good. One less "
295,"thing."""
296,And you know what...
297,"Hello, Jenny."
298,...big ol' gobs of rain and little 
299,bitty stinging rain and rain...
300,New shoes.
301,Mm-hmm.
302,Will you marry me? I'd make a good 
303,"husband, Jenny."
304,But you won't marry me.
305,"Why don't you love me, Jenny? I'm "
306,"not a smart man, but I know what "
307,love is.
308,Jenny?
309,"For no particular reason, I just "
310,kept on going. I ran clear to the 
311,ocean.
312,"When I had to go, you know, I went."
313,Yeah.
314,I just felt like running.
315,I just left like running.
316,"Now, for some reason what I was doing "
317,seemed to make sense to people.
318,"...it gave people hope. Now... Now, "
319,"I don't know anything about that, "
320,but...
321,It happens.
322,Sometimes.
323,Have a nice day.
324,I'm pretty tired. I think I'll go 
325,home now.
326,"Oh, thank you, Miss, Miss Louise."
327,...wondering if I could come down to 
328,"Savannah to see her, and that's what "
329,"I'm doing here. She saw me on TV, "
330,"running, I'm supposed to go on the "
331,Number Nine bus to Richmond Street 
332,and get off and go one block left to 
333,"1-9-4-7 Henry Street, Apartment 4."
334,Down that way?
335,It was nice talking' to you.
336,Hi.
337,I got your letter.
338,Is this your house?
339,It's nice. You got air conditioning.
340,Ah...
341,I ate some.
342,I ran a long way. For a long time.
343,Hello.
344,"You're a momma, Jenny."
345,Like me.
346,"He got a daddy named Forrest, too?"
347,He's the most beautiful thing I've 
348,"ever seen. But... is, is he smart, "
349,or is he...
350,What are you watching.
351,"What, do you have a cough due to "
352,cold?
353,"You could come home with me. Jenny, "
354,you and little Forrest could come 
355,stay at my house in Greenbow. I'll 
356,take care of you if you're sick.
357,Okay.
358,Lieutenant Dan? Lieutenant Dan!
359,You got new legs. New legs!
360,Magic legs.
361,Lieutenant Dan!
362,"Lieutenant Dan, this is my Jenny."
363,Hey.
364,"Yes. Well, I, I don't know."
365,You were.
366,And I had you placed here under our 
367,tree.
368,And I had that house of your father's 
369,bulldozed to the ground.
370,...always said dyin' was a part of 
371,life.
372,"I sure wish it wasn't. Little Forrest, "
373,he's doing just fine.
374,...every day. I make sure he combs 
375,his hair and brushes his teeth every 
376,day. Teaching him how to play ping 
377,pong.
378,Okay...
379,"Forrest, you go."
380,"And every night, we read a book."
381,"He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so "
382,"proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a "
383,"letter, and he says I can't read it. "
384,"I'm not supposed to, so I'll just "
385,leave it here for you.
386,"Jenny, I don't know if Momma was "
387,"right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan."
388,I don't know if we each have a 
389,"destiny, or if we're all just floating "
390,"around accidental-like on a breeze, "
391,"but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe "
392,both is happening at the same time. 
393,"I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything "
394,"you need, I won't be far away."
395,Here's your bus. Okay.
396,"Hey, I know this."
397,My favorite book.
398,Well...
399,"...okay. Hey, there you go."
400,"Hey, Forrest. Don't... I wanted to "
401,tell you I love you.
402,I'll be right here when you get back.
