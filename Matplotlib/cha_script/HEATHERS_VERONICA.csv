0,"What's your damage, Heather? You"
1,ruined my...
2,"Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus..."
3,"Hello, Heather."
4,"Shit, Heather. I don't have anything"
5,against Martha Dunnstock.
6,I'll think about it.
7,"Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater"
8,tots; it's a real party continent.
9,Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So
10,what's the question?
11,"Hey, this question wouldn't be that"
12,bizarro thing you were babbling
13,about over the phone last......
14,Betty Finn. Gosh.....
15,I'm really sorry I couldn't make it
16,to your birthday party last month.
17,Don't say that.
18,I was talking with someone!
19,"Wake up. In two days, Earth's going"
20,up like a Roman Candle. Crab Nebula City.
21,You're beautiful.
22,"I'm sorry, it's just why can't we"
23,talk to different kinds of people?
24,Doesn't it bother you that everyone in
25,the school thinks you're a pirahna?
26,Pretend you're a missionary saving
27,a colony of cootie victims.
28,What about you Rodney?
29,If you're going to openly be a bitch....
30,Damn..
31,Don't tell me. Crest would be
32,stained with loserness.
33,I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
34,We made a girl want to consider
35,suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
36,A true friend's work is never done.
37,Maybe you should see a doctor.
38,"Geez, don't listen to them."
39,"Well, you better move Holden out"
40,of the way or he's going to get spewed.
41,Give me the clipboard.
42,Hello Jason Dean.
43,"No, a Veronica. Sawyer. This may"
44,seem like a stupid question....
45,If you inherit five million dollars
46,the same day aliens tell the earth
47,"they're blowing us up in two days,"
48,what would you do?
49,How very.
50,No way. He used blanks. All J.D.
51,really did was ruin two pairs of
52,pants...Maybe not even that...
53,Can you bleach out urine stains?
54,Never say never.
55,Give it up girl!
56,Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've
57,been set up with? Witty and urbane
58,pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
59,All right.
60,"I don't know, it was okay, I guess."
61,I guess.
62,Maybe. There's kind of a dark
63,horse now in the running.
64,Because you're an idiot.
65,"Great pate, but I'm going to have"
66,to motor if I want to be ready for
67,the party tonight.
68,"No, but if you're nice I'll let"
69,you buy me a Slurpee. You know
70,your 7-11speak pretty well.
71,Really? That thing in the caf
72,today was pretty severe.
73,I didn't. Cherry.
74,Great bike.
75,I don't know. Should you?
76,Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's
77,Fred Dean Construction. Must be
78,rough. Moving place to place.
79,"Sure, I'm on my way to a party"
80,at Remington University.
81,It's not perfect. I don't really
82,like my friends.
83,It's like they're just people I
84,work with and our job is being
85,popular and shit.
86,"No, not at all."
87,BRAD
88,You're pretty enough to be one.
89,"Gee, thanks."
90,Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV
91,anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
92,"Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?"
93,J.F.K.!
94,"Hey really, I don't feel so great."
95,I have a little prepared speech I
96,give when my suitor wants more
97,than I'd like to give him....
98,"Gee Blank, I had a nice...."
99,You don't deserve my fucking speech!
100,"Heather, I feel awful, like I'm"
101,"going to throw up. Can we jam, please?"
102,You goddamn bitch!
103,"Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up."
104,S'okay....
105,Sure. But I'm Blue.
106,What a night.
107,What a life. I almost moved into high
108,school out of sixth grade because I
109,was some genius. We all decided to
110,chuck the idea because I'd have
111,"trouble making friends, blah-blah-blah."
112,Now blah-blah-blah is all I do. I use
113,my grand I.Q. to figure out what gloss
114,to wear and how to hit three keggers
115,before curfew. Some genius.
116,Killing her won't solve anything.
117,"Well then, I'll pray for rain."
118,"Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky."
119,There's a big difference between
120,the most popular girl in the school
121,and dead sperm.
122,I know exactly what the hell you're
123,"talking about and you're right, you"
124,don't know what the hell you're
125,"talking about. Let's just grow up,"
126,"be adults, and die."
127,"But before that, I'd like to see"
128,Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
129,Trust me. She skips the Saturday
130,morning trip to Grandma's even
131,when she's not hungover.
132,What about orange juice and milk?
133,What's the upchuck factor on that?
134,Don't be a dick. That stuff'll
135,kill her.
136,O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put
137,"it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it"
138,be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
139,What are you doing? You just
140,"can't go.....Besides, she'd never"
141,drink anything that looks like that.
142,"Just give me a cup, jerk."
143,tears it from him and pours some milk and then some orange
144,juice into the cup.
145,Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe
146,we could cough a phlegm globber in
147,it or something.
148,"No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll"
149,do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
150,You're not funny.
151,Bonehead.
152,"Morning, Heather."
153,We both said a lot of things we
154,"didn't mean, last night."
155,"No shit, sherlock. I can't believe"
156,it. I just killed my best friend.
157,"Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna..."
158,Stop kidding around. I'm going to
159,have to send my S.A.T. scores to
160,San Quentin instead of Stanford.
161,It's one thing to want somebody out
162,of your life. It's another thing to
163,serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
164,Like a suicide thing?
165,I can do Heather's handwriting as
166,well as my own.
167,"""You might think what I've done is"
168,"shocking..."""
169,"That's good, but Heather would"
170,"never use the word ""myriad."""
171,"She missed ""myriad"" on a vocab"
172,"test two weeks ago, all right?"
173,"You're probably right...""People think"
174,just because you're beautiful and
175,"popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody"
176,"understood I had feelings too."""
177,That's good. Have you done this before?
178,"Heather was cool, but cruel. The good"
179,"looks and bad manners gave her power,"
180,but it could not give her happiness.
181,She realized the only way she could
182,be happy was to give up her power and
183,the only way she could do that was death.
184,"Watch it, Heather. You could actually"
185,be digesting food.
186,"stands facing the viewer, the Swatch noticeably attached."
187,Uh-huh.
188,"Next channel, darling."
189,"Oh, I have to hear this."
190,What are you talking about? She
191,hated you! You hated her!
192,What are you smiling at?
193,Yeah. Scary stuff.
194,Hello.
195,My Mom's making my favorite meal
196,tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
197,Right.
198,All right.
199,"I don't know, it was okay, I guess."
200,Maybe.
201,Because you're an idiot.
202,"Greate pate, but I'm going to have"
203,to motor if I want to be ready for
204,the funeral tomorrow.
205,and J.D. watch from the back pew.
206,Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
207,"Heather, I've got something"
208,going with J.D.
209,"All right, but I hope it isn't"
210,going to be one of those nights where
211,they get shitfaced and take us to a
212,pasture to tip cows.
213,and HEATHER MCNAMARA look on.
214,"Yeah, right, asshole."
215,I'm doing a favor for Heather. A
216,double date. I tried to tell you
217,at the funeral but you rode off.
218,"So what? Don't smile like that, Jesus!"
219,Hi Guys. I came to check on this
220,week's lunchtime poll topic.
221,Oh. Sure.
222,The what?
223,I don't know. This thing leaves a
224,bad taste in my mouth.
225,I'm sorry? I don't get it.
226,Yeah. And? I left him drunk and
227,flailing in cowshit.
228,Don't shut up. I'd like to know just
229,what I did.
230,Pardon the pun. Son-of-a-bitch.
231,"Thanks Pete, for the Famine Fund."
232,"Hi, Kurt? This is Veronica Sawyer. I"
233,didn't expect to be calling either. I
234,guess my emotions took over. I was
235,wondering if you wanted all those
236,things you've been saying to really
237,happen. It's always been a fantasy of
238,mine to have two guys at once......
239,"Sure, you can write Penthouse Forum."
240,"That's right, tonight. In the woods"
241,behind the school. Don't forget Ram.
242,breaks into a laugh.
243,I don't get the point of me writing
244,a suicide note when we'll just be
245,shooting them with blanks.
246,"You can't be serious? Hey listen,"
247,my Bonnie-and-Clyde days are over.
248,French.
249,So it looks like the person's been
250,shot and killed when they're really
251,just unconscious and bleeding.
252,First tell me this similarity is
253,not incredible.
254,Ram and I died the day we realized
255,we could never reveal our forbidden
256,love to an uncaring and ununderstanding
257,world. The joy we shared in each other's
258,arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet
259,we were forced to live the lie of Sexist-
260,Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
261,We don't want to make them out to be
262,too secretly eloquent. Why would the
263,Germans invent a bullet that doesn't
264,kill people? I mean it was World War
265,"Two, not a school play."
266,Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
267,Oh.
268,You must have had fun.
269,Oh come on. Lots of people drink
270,Perrier. It's come a long way.
271,"Oh, you're so smart. How about a"
272,little heterosexuality before we go?
273,Hi Guys. Glad you could make it.
274,I've made a circle on each end of
275,"the clearing. Ram, you come over here."
276,"When you get in the circle, strip."
277,I was hoping you'd rip my clothes
278,"off me, sport."
279,"Count of three, guys."
280,One.
281,Two.
282,Shucks.
283,"Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth"
284,it just to see the look on....
285,zombiesquely does the same with KURT and her gun.
286,Kurt doesn't look too good.
287,"We killed them, didn't we?"
288,Ich Luge bullets! I'm an idiot!
289,I did not want them dead.
290,Did not.
291,Did not.
292,Sure. Can we make an ice run
293,before the funeral?
294,Your son's dead and you love him.
295,"collapses onto her couch, splaying next to her MOM. The"
296,Sawyer T.V. flashes against Veronica's shades.
297,Superb.
298,That's three things.
299,"No, it's okay J.D., I just kind of"
300,"wanted to talk.....Oh, a newsmagazine"
301,show on Channel 16. Really? On the
302,"suicides. No, sounds great. Bye."
303,"takes off her sunglasses, squints, then continues down the hall."
304,Can't you see this is a special moment?
305,Yes. Yes. We'll work something out.
306,I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
307,"You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms."
308,Fleming wants to redefine the high
309,school experience.
310,Don't even talk about that stuff!
311,You can be so immature!
312,Oh beautiful. The Beaver's home.
313,Do you like your father?
314,Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming
315,has given us a chance to atone for...
316,Maybe.
317,We're breaking up. I am out!
318,"You're getting too cool for me, J.D."
319,I don't know how to talk to you.
320,I'm going to make this Ms. Pauline
321,thing work. Lines of communication
322,between the cliques. You were a phase....
323,Something like that. Will you do it?
324,I just want to show different kinds
325,of people can get together and it
326,doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't
327,get treated badly here do you?
328,"Things are going to change, Earl."
329,Heather.
330,Ouch. Your machine's got the most
331,"obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry."
332,Is this David? Heather's David?
333,What are you doing....
334,I'm delirious for the both of you.
335,Can you put Heather on?
336,"Hello, Betty....."
337,"Don't get cocky, girl."
338,That's bullshit. Just shoot.
339,Shoot.
340,"Betty, your daydreams are a lot"
341,"better than my realities, believe"
342,me. I'm afraid though it's time to
343,get your butt kicked.
344,"It's not my style, okay?"
345,Sure. See ya.
346,So did you call people to tell them
347,how to get to the studio tonight?
348,You're so polluted. Talking down to
349,"people, making fake notes...."
350,"No, you're wrong. It's not even"
351,your turn.
352,Ich Luge bullets. I'm such a jerk.
353,I was waiting for my friend Betty.
354,"Shucks, that's a great idea, Pete."
355,But my name's not...
356,I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there
357,were going to be different kinds of social
358,and psychological types at this gathering.
359,"The world wants winners, I guess."
360,Not people stained with loserness.
361,"It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll"
362,"excuse me, I'm going to go throw up."
363,"But Ms. Fleming, it's just not right."
364,Oh yeah.
365,Color me educated. I learned high
366,"school happiness is for members only,"
367,Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality
368,"if it lived in her uterus, and reality's"
369,"name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a"
370,major creep.
371,This condescending junk makes suicide
372,seem like a cool thing to do. Hey
373,"kids, make your parents and teachers"
374,feel like shit! Get the respect in
375,death you'll never get in life.
376,Everybody cares for youth but nobody
377,cares about Joey Blow. When that news
378,reporter gets home he'll scream at his
379,son for not mowing the lawn in the
380,right pattern.
381,All we want is to be treated like
382,"human beings, not like guinea pigs"
383,to be experimented on and not like
384,bunny rabbits to be patronized.
385,I guess I picked the wrong time to
386,be a human being.
387,Is she dead?
388,I said I was sorry.
389,You're not funny. Ouch!
390,Just shut up and turn on the radio.
391,Hot Probs is on.
392,What were you trying to do? Sleep?
393,You're giving your life away to
394,become a goddamn statistic in U.S.
395,Fucking A Today. That's got to be
396,the least private thing I can think of.
397,"If everyone jumped off a bridge,"
398,"young lady, would you?"
399,"Hey now, if you were happy every day"
400,"of your life, you wouldn't be a human"
401,"being, you'd be a game show host."
402,Sure.
403,People love you but I know you.
404,Jennifer Forbes told me the petition
405,she signed was to put a jacuzzi in
406,the cafeteria. And Doug Hylton...
407,Don't talk to me like that.
408,No.
409,"Heather, why can't you just be a"
410,friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
411,I was thinking more along the lines
412,of slitting Heather Duke's wrists
413,open and making it look like a suicide.
414,"It's over, J.D.  Over!"
415,Yes?
416,Oh my God....
417,"Get off my bed, you sick psycho!"
418,You think you're a rebel! You're
419,not a rebel! You're a sick psycho!
420,Do you think you're a rebel? Do you
421,think you're a rebel? I wanna know!
422,Wait a....You're not listening! I'm
423,not on your side....
424,You're still not listening! I'm not..
425,This knife is filthy.
426,I think I know Heather a bit better
427,"than you, okay? If she was going to"
428,"slash her wrists, the knife would"
429,be absolutely spotless.
430,Tomorrow someone else will move
431,into her place. That person
432,could be me.
433,"Ha, there's only one of us who knows"
434,Heather's handwriting and if you think
435,I'm doing another suicide note.
436,No-o!
437,races to the door wailing. She maniacally rattles the doorknob
438,trying to open the locked door.
439,Heather? Wha...
440,What are you doing here?!
441,"Hey Mom, why so tense?"
442,as she chokes on some styrofoam cup coffee.
443,Where is he? Where's J.D.?
444,Get a job.
445,"Rodney, where's everybody going?"
446,"Oh my God, the damn pep assembly...."
447,"Rodney, what's underneath the gym?"
448,"Like father, like son. A serious-as-"
449,fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll
450,set off a pack of thermals upstairs.
451,"Okay, so let's start by slowly putting"
452,the bomb down on the ground.
453,"Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that."
454,Put your hands on your head.
455,sees a fire alarm on a nearby wall. She closes her eyes then
456,savagely knees J.D. in the groin. VERONICA bolts to the alarm
457,and pulls it down. Nothing happens. J.D. gasps.
458,"The bomb's gone on, J.D.! How do"
459,you turn it off? Tell me!
460,"It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it."
461,How do you turn the fucker off?
462,"The bomb, asshole!"
463,"You know what I want, babe?"
464,Cool guys like you out of my life.
465,"But babe, don't worry, these here"
466,were Ich Luge bullets.
467,"presses the red button twice, turning on the red light and"
468,stopping the clock. VERONICA falls back into a sitting
469,"position and sorely exhales, tears streaming down her face."
470,I thought I...you..
471,Perfecto.
472,"Yeah, I just got back."
473,"Heather, my love, there's a"
474,new sheriff in town.
475,"Hey, Martha, wait up."
476,My date for the prom kind of flaked
477,"out on me, so I thought if you"
478,weren't doing anything that night
479,we could go to the video store and
480,rent some new releases or something.
481,Maybe pop some popcorn.
482,So would I.
