0,Pleased to meet you.
1,A work placement?
2,Aren't you going to tell me
3,anything?
4,Why?
5,Such as?
6,I'm discovering it.
7,How?
8,But are you trying to fool him that
9,the dream is actually real life?
10,How could I ever get enough detail
11,to Convince him that it's real?
12,But all the textures of real life-
13,"the stone, the fabric. cars..."
14,people... your mind can't create
15,all this.
16,I guess.
17,We came here from...
18,Oh my God. We're dreaming.
19,"If it's just a dream, why are you"
20,covering your-
21,How did architects get involved?
22,We were only asleep for five
23,minutes? We talked for an hour at
24,least...
25,Who are the people?
26,Yours?
27,How else do you do it?
28,Then you break in and steal it.
29,I love the concrete sense of things-
30,"Real weight, you know? I thought a"
31,dream space would be all about the
32,"visual, but it's the feel of"
33,"things. Question is, what happens"
34,as you start to mess with
35,physics...
36,"It's something, isn't it?"
37,Why are they looking at me?
38,Converge?
39,They're going to attack us?
40,Mind telling your subconscious to
41,take it easy?
42,I cross it every day on my way to
43,the college.
44,You have to draw from what you know-
45,Why not?
46,Did that happen to you?
47,Is that why you need me to build
48,your dreams?
49,"Wake me up, Cobb."
50,Wake me up!
51,Why couldn't I wake?
52,What?
53,That's some subconscious you've
54,"got, Cobb."
55,She's a real charmer!
56,She's his wife?
57,Like a coin?
58,What's yours?
59,Why?
60,That's not an issue for me.
61,"Arthur, maybe you can't see what's"
62,"going on, maybe you don't want to."
63,But Cobb's got problems he's tried
64,to bury down there. I'm not going
65,to open my mind to someone like
66,that.
67,I tried not to come.
68,"No paper, no pens... nothing"
69,"between you and raw, direct"
70,creation.
71,What sort of tricks?
72,How big do the levels have to be?
73,A maze.
74,The longer we have before the
75,projections catch us.
76,My subconscious seems polite
77,enough.
78,"Cobb can't build anymore, can he?"
79,Why?
80,His ex-wife?
81,They're still together?
82,What was she like in real life?
83,You're back.
84,Are you going under on your own?
85,Just working on my totem.
86,It's an elegant solution to keeping
87,track of reality. Your invention?
88,Arthur told me she died.
89,Good. Each level relates to the
90,part of the subject's subconscious
91,we're trying to access. I'm making
92,"the bottom level a hospital, so"
93,that Fischer will bring his father
94,there-
95,Why's that so important?
96,In case you bring Mal in.
97,You won't build yourself because if
98,"you know the maze, then she knows"
99,it. And she'd sabotage the
100,"operation. You can't keep her out,"
101,can you?
102,Do the others know?
103,You have to warn them if it's
104,getting worse-
105,"Why can't you go home, Cobb?"
106,How did she die?
107,For what?
108,How much time?
109,And ten years in the third level.
110,Who wants to spend ten years in a
111,dream?
112,What's a kick?
113,"I wanted to know what ""tests"" you"
114,need to do on your own every night.
115,Why do you do this to yourself?
116,Is it so important to dream?
117,"But these aren't just dreams, are"
118,they? They're memories. You said
119,never to use memories.
120,You're keeping her alive.
121,You can't let her go.
122,What've you got buried down there
123,that you regret?
124,This is your house?
125,Where is she?
126,My name is-
127,I don't know. Trying to understand.
128,No.
129,What is this place?
130,What happened here?
131,You think you can just build a
132,prison of memories to lock her in?
133,You think that's going to contain
134,her?
135,I'm coming with you.
136,The team needs someone in there who
137,understands what you're struggling
138,with. If you don't want it to be me
139,then you need to show Arthur what I
140,just saw.
141,This wasn't in the design-
142,I didn't.
143,How could they be trained?
144,Limbo?
145,What's down there?
146,How long would we be stuck there?
147,He's in a lot of pain.
148,And if he dies?
149,What will that do to him?
150,When were you trapped in Limbo?
151,"Cobb, you might have convinced the"
152,rest of this team to carry on with
153,the job. But they don't know the
154,truth.
155,The truth that at any minute you
156,might bring a freight train through
157,the wall. The truth that Mal is
158,bursting up through your
159,subconscious.
160,The truth that as we go deeper into
161,"Fischer, we're also going deeper"
162,into you-and I'm not sure we're
163,going to like what we find there.
164,"This is not just about Fischer,"
165,it's about you. Tell me what
166,happened to you and Mal. Trapped in
167,Limbo.
168,How long were you stuck?
169,How did you stand it?
170,But not for her?
171,And when you finally woke up?
172,What was it?
173,What about your children?
174,Psychiatrists judged her sane?
175,Then why should you blame yourself?
176,It might have been your idea to
177,"push the limits, Cobb. But you're"
178,not responsible for the idea that
179,destroyed her. The idea that her
180,world wasn't real... that was her
181,own idea from her own mind.
182,I'm doing it for the others. They
183,don't know the risk they've taken
184,coming in here with you.
185,So you destroy his one positive
186,relationship?
187,"Who or what, exactly, is Mr."
188,Charles?
189,And why don't you approve?
190,Didn't Cobb say never to do that?
191,What's happening?
192,Do you use a timer?
193,How will you know?
194,Why not?
195,"Wait, Cobb-I'm lost. Whose"
196,subconscious are we going into?
197,What's down there?
198,I meant what's down there for you?
199,I designed the place.
200,How long do we have?
201,Sixty minutes.
202,I don't think so. They've still got
203,to climb down to the middle
204,terrace.
205,The building's designed as a
206,labyrinth.
207,Yes.
208,I shouldn't tell you. If Mal-
209,"Utility closets, trap doors..."
210,Ducts. He added an air duct system-
211,it doesn't follow the maze. They
212,can use it to go straight from the
213,outer walls to the upper tower.
214,Saito?
215,What was that?
216,That's the antechamber outside the
217,strongroom.
218,Wouldn't be very strong if it did.
219,"Look, if you wanted to design it"
220,yourself-
221,"These projections, they're part of"
222,his subconscious?
223,Are you destroying those parts of
224,his mind?
225,"Fischer, stop! It's a trap!-"
226,"Cobb, that's not really her-"
227,"Cobb, she's just a projection."
228,Fischer... he's real.
229,Eames? Get to the anteroom now!
230,Mal killed Fischer-
231,There's still a way: We follow
232,Fischer down-
233,Down there they'll be enough time.
234,We'll find him-soon as you hear
235,"Arthur's music start, you use the"
236,defibrillator to revive him-we give
237,him his own early kick from below.
238,Get him in there-
239,"Then, as the music ends you blow"
240,the hospital and we all ride the
241,kick back up through the layers.
242,We have to try!
243,Can I trust you to do what's
244,needed? Mal's down there-
245,How do you know?
246,This is your world?
247,You built all this?
248,It's incredible.
249,From what city?
250,You reconstructed them all from
251,memory?
252,What's that?
253,Will she be in there?
254,How do we send Fischer back?
255,What?
256,Why?
257,We need Fischer.
258,"Cobb, what are you saying?"
259,"Cobb, you can't do this."
260,He's here. And it's time. But you
261,have to come with us.
262,"Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose"
263,yourself in here! You have to get
264,back to your children!
265,You can't stay here to be with her-
266,No!
267,Improvising.
268,You're coming!
269,Don't lose yourself. Find Saito.
270,And bring him back.
271,Cobb stayed.
272,No. To find Saito.
273,No. He'll be alright.
