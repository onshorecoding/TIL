40,"Do you ever dream, Forrest, about "
41,who you're gonna be?
42,Yeah.
43,"Well, you'll always be you, just "
44,another kind of you. You know? I 
45,want to be famous.
46,I want to be a singer like Joan Baez.
47,I just want to be an empty stage 
48,"with my guitar, my voice... just me."
49,And I want to reach people on a 
50,personal level. I want to be able to 
51,"say things, just one-to-one."
52,"Have you ever been with a girl, "
53,Forrest?
54,It's okay.
55,It's all right.
56,It's okay.
57,I bet that never happened in home 
58,ec.
59,"I don't care. I don't like her, "
60,anyway.
61,"""Yes, and how many seas must the "
62,"white dove said, before she sleeps "
63,"in the sand."""
64,"""Yes, how many times must the "
65,cannonballs fly before they're forever 
66,"banned."""

68,the wind. The answer is blowing in...
69,Hey! Hey! Stupid jerk! I'm singing a 
70,"song here. Polly, get out here!"
71,"Shut up! Oh, shut up!"
72,"Forrest, what are you doing here? "
73,What are you doing?
74,"What are you doing? Forrest, let me "
75,down!
76,"You can't keep doing this, Forrest."
77,You can't keep tryin' to rescue me 
78,all the time.
79,A lot of people try to grab me. Just --
80,you can't keep doing this all the 
81,time!
82,"Forrest, you don't know what love "
83,is.
84,"You remember that time we prayed, "
85,Forrest? We prayed for God to turn 
86,"me into a bird so I could fly far, "
87,far away?
88,You think I can fly off this bridge?
89,Nothing.
90,I gotta get outta here.
91,"Forrest, you stay away from me, okay?"
92,"You just stay away from me, please."
93,Can I have a ride?
94,I don't care.
95,Just hang on a minute.
96,"Listen, you promise me something, "
97,"okay? Just if you're ever in trouble, "
98,"don't try to be brave, you just run, "
99,okay? Just run away.
100,Forrest! Forrest!
101,Forrest!
102,Hey! Hey!
103,"Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's "

105,I ran into a friend.
106,This is my good friend I told you 
107,"about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest, "
108,this is Wesley. Wesley and I live

112,"Okay, but..."
113,You are a fucking asshole!
114,Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest!
115,Stop it!
116,Stop it!
117,"Come on, Forrest."
118,He doesn't mean it when he does things 
119,like this. He doesn't.
120,"I know you wouldn't, Forrest."
121,"That uniform is a trip, Forrest. You "
122,look handsome in it. You do.
123,What?
124,"Me too, Forrest. I have so much to "
125,"tell you, you won't believe what's "
126,been going on...
127,"""Smile on your brother, everybody "
128,"get together, try to love on another "
129,"right now"""
130,I'll go.
131,"I have to, Forrest."
132,"Forrest, we have very different lives, "
133,you know.
134,"Forrest, I can't keep this."
135,Why're you so good to me?
136,I'll always be your girl.
137,"Hello, Forrest."
138,How could you do this?
139,"Okay, you can open your eyes."
140,They make them just for running.
141,You done watching it?
142,I'm going to bed.
143,"You would, Forrest."
144,You don't want to marry me.
145,"Forrest, I do love you."
146,I'm not running.
147,I'll be damned. Forrest...
148,Hey! Forrest! How you doing?
149,Come in. Come in.
150,"Oh, I was wondering about that."
151,"Yeah, it's messy right now. I just "
152,got off work.
153,Thank you.
154,"Hey, I kept, I kept a scrapbook of "
155,"your, of your clippings and "
156,"everything. There you are. This, I "
157,got your running.
158,"There. Listen, Forrest. I don't know "
159,"how to say this. Um, I just... I "
160,want to apologize for anything that 
161,"I ever did to you, 'cause I was messed "
162,"up for a long time, and..."
163,Hey.
164,"Hey, you. This is an old friend from "
165,Alabama.
166,"Ah, listen, next week my schedule "
167,"changes, so I'll be able to... but "
168,thanks for picking up.
169,Okay.
170,"Thanks. This is very good friend, "
171,Mr. Gump. Can you say hi to him?
172,"Yes, you can. Just keep it low."
173,I'm a momma. His name is Forrest.
174,I named him after his Daddy.
175,"You're his daddy, Forrest."
176,"Hey, Forrest, look at me. Look at "
177,"me, Forrest. There's nothing you "
178,"need to do, okay? You didn't do "
179,anything wrong. Okay?
180,Isn't he beautiful?
181,He's very smart. He's one of the 
182,smartest in his class.
183,"Yeah, it's okay. Go talk to him."
184,"Forrest, I'm sick."
185,I have some kind virus. And the 
186,"doctors don't, they don't know what "
187,it is. And there isn't anything they 
188,can do about it.
189,"Would you marry me, Forrest?"
190,Hi. Your tie.
191,"Hey, it's nice to meet you, finally."
192,Hey.
193,"Hey, Forrest, were you scared in "
194,Vietnam?
195,I wish I could have been there with 
196,you.
197,I love you.
