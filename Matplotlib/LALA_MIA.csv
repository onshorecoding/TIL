0,"...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity. Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it -- Shit. It's -- five past... Ok. I wanted to give you an entrance. Eh... I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. I don't know if they were there. Can't. Working. Yes? It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. This looks familiar.             I was going to give it back! I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- No, Jamal. You be trippin'. Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...  17. ""I Ran"". ""Curt""? Ok. My God. Did you just call yourself ""a serious musician""? Can I borrow what you're wearing? Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic. He just told you what to do. Mia. George Michael! Did you just get your keys? Can you grab mine? The Prius. They are...n't. Strange that we keep running into each other. I doubt it. What? Uh-huh. Oh my God. Agreed. I've seen better. ...Ok... No... I have an audition. Remember? But you said -- ...Hi. What are you doing here? Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot? I'm off in ten. That's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca. Yeah. Greg. We've been seeing each other for a few months. Oh yeah? A what? We need to wait here. Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an actress. She was in this traveling theater company... And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up. This was Boulder City, Nevada -- every house looked exactly the same. I was ten and already I needed to get out. And one day, my aunt flew into town, and she showed me the library's old-movie section. We spent a whole day watching one after the other. Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca. I never knew the world was so big. I started putting on plays in my garage. I'd write the scripts and print up programs, and she'd give me props to use from wherever she'd just been -- New York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet off again and I wouldn't hear from her for another year. God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That would have been terrifying. Well it doesn't need more actresses. What do you mean, ""just an actress""? That is not what I said. Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible. Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. I hate jazz. It means when I listen to it I don't like it. I do hate some animals. I thought it was just Kenny G. I associate it with facials. It's relaxing. Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese. Your club? Hi, I just missed a call... That show I told you about. Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel Without a Cause. Obviously. No. It's the one I lie about. ...Ok.           31. Ok. For research. Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot. Well -- it's not picked up yet. First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV.            32. Well, no, I have a call-back. It's another audition. ...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment. Oxygen. You know what, I have to go. I love you. Two options. Follow my rules, or follow my rules. Kapish? You want to bully, you'd best be ready to get bullied -- I can do it another way -- Shit. No. Yes. I'll change... I'm sorry. It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself. Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman show... I think so. Hey, Mia.                         Hey... Nice meeting you. ...You're just saying that. I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic? But do you think people will like it? You always say that. Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise. I made something for you. It could be the name design. On the door. That's what you should name it. Sebastian, no one's going to a club called ""Chicken on a Stick"". No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. And it's time to start looking for other places. Make your own history. I'm doing that. The one who offered you a gig. Why was it weird between you two? He did offer you a job. Are you going to call him? Ok... City of stars...              You've never shined so brightly.            50. Thanks Harry, I'm good.        52. I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure... Nothing... I guess. I'm adapting. He told me. Do you think he's happy? I mean with the band, the travel, all of it.         53. Hey it's me... Not sure where you are -- maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I haven't heard from you in a while... I miss you... Ok... Bye... Stay. I'm nervous.  55. Because... What if people show up? I'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people. I'm terrified. I can. Ugh. Boise? To Boise?      56. Wish I could. Come to Boise? Because I have to rehearse. You mean anywhere you are? Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical... I know, but when are you done? When are you done with the tour?    57. So it's...the long haul? I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time. I don't know, I didn't think the band would -- No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now? Do you like the music you're playing? It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years.     58. Yes. I do. I just didn't think you did. And now I hear you're going to be on the road for years, and I'm -- What do you mean why am I doing this? To be in this band? Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you could take care of yourself and start your club. Why aren't you starting your club? Change the name! I do like jazz now, because of you. People will want to go to it! People love what other people are passionate about. You had a dream that you were sticking to, that -- This is not your dream. Why do you care so much about being liked -- ? Are you kidding? Stop -- It's over. I'm done embarrassing myself. No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater. Not anymore. Night, sweetie.                 Night, Mom. I'm ok. I'm good... You took down the swing. Oh God. Throw those away. Why did you come here? Ok... I know who she is. I'm not going. I'm -- no... That will kill me. Yes.     70. I'm happier. I told you. Because it's another audition! I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do you want to know what happens? Either they interrupt me because someone ordered a sandwich, or they cut me off after two seconds, or I'm crying and they start laughing, or I'm one of a hundred lookalikes in the waiting room who never has a chance, because -- -- because -- Because I'm probably not good enough. No. Maybe I'm not. Why what? ...Because it hurts a little bit too much. How did you find me? Hi, Mia.                        Hi. ...Ok. ...About...? My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once... They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out. No, I'm not. Where are we? I mean -- where are we? What do we do? If I get this --            75. What are you going to do? Right. You know I'm always going to love you. I've seen better.          76. I've never been here during the day. Hi... Iced coffee, please. No, no, that's fine. Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea. We can just see it back in New York... I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- No... We should go. "
