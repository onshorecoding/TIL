0,"Vincent. Vincent. I'm on the intercom. It's on the wall by the two African  fellas. To your right. ...warm. Warmer. Disco. Push the button if you want to talk. Go make yourself a drink., and I'll  be down in two shakes of a lamb's  tail. The bar's by the fireplace. Let's go. This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis  man should love it. You can get a steak here, daddy-o.  Don't be a... I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger   bloody  and a five-dollar shake. Martin and Lewis. Sure did. Uh-huh. Whaddya think? What are you doing? Here? Oh. Well in that case, will you roll  me one, cowboy? Thanks. Marsellus said you just got back  from Amsterdam. That was my fifteen minutes. It was show about a team of female  secret agents called ""Fox Force Five."" ""Fox Force Five."" Fox, as in we're a  bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in  we're a force to be reckoned with.  Five, as in there's one... two ...  three... four... five of us. There  was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal  from that show ""Baton Rouge,"" she  was the leader. A Japanese one, a  black one, a French one and a brunette  one, me.  We all had special skills.  Sommerset had a photographic memory,  the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,  the black girl was a demolition  expert, the French fox' specialty  was sex... Knives. The character I played, Raven  McCoy, her background was she was  raised by circus performers. So she  grew up doing a knife act. According  to the show, she was the deadliest  woman in the world with a knife. But  because she grew up in a circus, she  was also something of an acrobat.  She could do illusions, she was a  trapeze artist  when you're keeping  the world safe from evil, you never  know when being a trapeze artist's  gonna come in handy. And she knew a  zillion old jokes her grandfather,  an old vaudevillian, taught her. If  we woulda got picked up, they woulda  worked in a gimmick where every  episode I woulda told and ol joke. Well I only got the chance to say  one, 'cause we only did one show. No. It's really corny. No. You won't like it and I'll be  embarrassed. That's what I'm afraid of. You're quite the silver tongue devil,  aren't you? That's not what you said Vince. Well  now I'm definitely not gonna tell  ya, 'cause it's been built up too  much. Yummy! Be my guest. You can use my straw, I don't have  kooties. Kooties I can handle. Told ya. Don't you hate that? Uncomfortable silences. Why do we  feel it's necessary to yak about  bullshit in order to be comfortable? That's when you know you found  somebody special. When you can just  shit the fuck up for a minute, and  comfortably share silence. Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to  the bathroom and powder my nose,  while you sit here and think of  something to say. I said goddamn! Don't you love it when you go to the  bathroom and you come back to find  your food waiting for you? Which one, there's two Marilyn  Monroes. Pretty smart. Did ya think of something to say? Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like  mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you  actually have something to say. You can't promise something like  that. I have no idea what you're  gonna ask. You could ask me what  you're gonna ask me, and my natural  response could be to be offended.  Then, through no fault of my own, I  woulda broken my promise. That is an impossibility. Trying to  forget anything as intriguing as  this would be an exercise in futility. Besides, it's more exciting when you  don't have permission. Who's Antwan? He fell out of a window. Is that a fact? Who told you this? They talk a lot, don't they? Well don't by shy Vincent, what  exactly did they say? Let me help you Bashful, did it  involve the F-word? And...? You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror  out of a four-story window because  he massaged my feet? And you believed that? Marsellus throwing Tony out of a  four story window for giving me a  foot massage seemed reasonable? A husband being protective of his  wife is one thing. A husband almost  killing another man for touching his  wife's feet is something else. The only thing Antwan ever touched  of mine was my hand, when he shook  it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding  then never again.  The truth is,  nobody knows why Marsellus tossed  Tony Rocky Horror out of that window  except Marsellus and Tony Rocky  Horror. But when you scamps get  together, you're worse than a sewing  circle. Right here. I wanna dance. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do  believe Marsellus, my husband, your  boss, told you to take me out and do  whatever I wanted, Now, I want to  dance. I want to win. I want that  trophy. So, dance good. Missus Mia Wallace. Vincent Vega. I don't know what that was. Music and drinks! That was a little bit more information  than I needed to know, but go right  ahead. (like you would say  Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,  you've been holding out on me. Something. What's yours? Don't worry about it. If Marsellus  ever heard of this, I'd be in as  much trouble as you. If you can keep a secret, so can I. You still wanna hear my ""FOX FORCE  FIVE"" joke? Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's  not funny. But if you still wanna  hear it, I'll tell it. Three tomatoes are walking down the  street, a poppa tomato, a momma  tomato, and a little baby tomato.  The baby tomato is lagging behind  the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa  tomato gets mad, goes over to the  momma tomato and stamps on him  and says: catch up. See ya 'round, Vince. Great. I never thanked you for the  dinner. "
