0,"Have a good.. ... life.  You put it on hold.  Look. You also called Mexico. Very romantic. I won't change my mind, mom. It's not about Forks, it's about  Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we  barely know each other.  I cut it since last time I saw you.  Good.  That's right. One bathroom. I can do it  Yeah... I think I remember.. Are they always like this? No way. The truck is for me? It's perfect! Maybe I can give you a ride to school. Too bad. Would've been nice to  know at least one person.  I'm kind of the suffer in silence type. I -- no, I'm not news -- I'm, seriously,  not at all  (hurries to him,  Just Bella.  That's why they kicked me out. Sorry. There's always eating disorders,  or Speedo padding on the swim team  Who are they? Who's he? I wasn't planning on it. Jerk. (doesn't remember at That'd be great, thank you. So... you eat here every night? I can cook. I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix.  Mom's not great in the kitchen. A few people... Do you know the  Cullen family? No... well, a little. ... Okay. Mom, where's your cell? Dad, I'm heading out. ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight. BELLA Great.  WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her  truck.  BELLA Dad, I can drive myself to school. Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated. You got me new tires. No one's  ever done that before. I mean... nothing. An animal? Be careful. And thank you. For the tires. Terrific.  I'm... yes.  You've been gone. Prophase.  Like I said. Seriously? You're asking me about the  weather? No. I don't like the cold. Or the  wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or  turtle necks.  It's complicated. My mother remarried.  Phil is fine. Young for her, but  nice enough. No... I -- I just.. Did you get contacts?  I'm fine, dad. Calm down. It's okay, Tyler. Dad, it's not his fault- But you didn't. It would have been a lot worse if Edward  hadn't knocked me out of the way. It was amazing he got to me so  fast. He was nowhere near me. You told her?! She's probably freaking. Can I talk to you for a moment? How did you get over to me so quickly?  You were next to your car, across  the lot. Yes. You were.  I know what I saw. You stopped that van. You pushed it away. I wasn't planning to tell anyone.  I just want to know the truth. No. Why did you even bother? ... Yeah, false alarm.. Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go  Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you  should ask Jessica.  Hello, Edward. Really? How did you know about that?  You haven't answered any of mine.  You won't even say hello. And how did you stop that van? No way. Zero weirdness. You guys  are great together. I know you do. Your fault, for telling her about  the accident. He is. Should I know what that means? I'll go if you stop saying that.  Thanks... but your mood swings are  giving me whiplash. What does that even mean? So let's say, for argument's sake,  that I'm not smart. Would you talk  to me? Tell me the truth?  Okay... how bout radioactive  spiders? Kryptonite? No. I don't believe that. You're  not bad. You can be a jerk, but  it's like this... mask. To keep  people away.  Look, why don't we just - hang out.  Like... come to the beach with us.  It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn,  salt water stinging your eyes.. La Push.  Is something wrong with that beach? You could ask him.  (off Angela's flustered  Guys, this is Jacob. Are you  stalking me? Definitely not.  To be polite. You know them? You want to go look at tide pools? So, what did your friend mean about  the Cullens not coming here? I can keep a secret.. Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath? So the legend about the Cullens is.. Didn't they just move here? Riiiight. So what was this treaty? Wait... what were they really?  They just... ditch? It's a family thing. Port Angeles?.. .  (a plan forming in her  Can I go with you guys?  It looks great.  Look, just take my bag. What -- no, how did you find --  No. Bad idea.  And you do? Okay, well. Thank you. I could eat. You're not eating? Like South Beach? So how bout some answers? I didn't ask for the square root of pi. How did you know where I was?  Were you following me? So that's a yes? You said before... That you heard  what those guys were thinking.. .  Can you... read minds? Why, what's wrong with me? What is it? Edward, you don't have to. Edward  I think I'm warm enough now.  Your hand, it's still freezing cold. He died? How?  The same kind that killed the security  guard down in Mason? So it's getting closer to town. But that's  Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon. That's probably not a good  ... it's not possible.. .  Off BELLA'S FACE, struggling to make sense of it all.. MATCH CUT: You're impossibly fast. And strong.  Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold.  Your eyes change color. And  sometimes you speak like... you're  from a different time.  How old are you? How long have you been seventeen? I know what the Cold Ones are.  What you are.  ... Vampire No.  You won't hurt me. You're different. Where are we going? No! The sunlight will kill you. Slow down. No. I'm not afraid. No! Edward? Where are you? You're... beautiful.. I don't believe that. I don't care. It doesn't matter. I trust you. I trust you, Edward. I'm here. Edward? Oh... I thought you hated me when we met. I know you can. I'm afraid. Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll  disappear. That I'll lose you. Stupid lamb. How long have you been like this? Where'd he find you? So Carlisle's the reason why you  hunt animals, instead of people.  Show off. Can they all read minds, too?  Your house? With your family? I'm glad I amuse you. What is it? Come to visit your truck? A person did that? It's... wonderful. EDWARD You expected turrets, dungeons and moats?  BELLA No... not moats. He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside. It's so light and open.  Bon giorno? Oh, absolutely  I just assumed -- because you don't  eat, you know.. I would never, ever tell anyone. ... Badly? And you're Jasper, right? Graduation caps? What a nightmare, repeating high school.  So you're obsessed with music. But.. No bed? Ever? Depends. Alternative? Jazz?  Sixties, seventies.. I'd have to say... Debussy. No dancing. No tripping, no falling, no derision.  You don't scare me. Don't you dare - In theory.  Everyone's staring. EDWARD Not that guy over -- yeah, he just  looked. Off his rakish, but reassuring smile.. Sorry I'm late. Biology project.  Order one for yourself next time.  You should cut back on the steak. Yeah, me, too.  He's just a friend. We're not really going to talk  about boys, are we? So spring training's going well? Actually, Forks is kind of growing on me.  Maybe.. Well... he is kind of a history buff. I, uh... have to go. I'll call you later, Mom.  How did you get in here? You've been here before? You're a peeping Tom! Perv! Oh... I'm... oh. Wish I could say the same. I'm so  embarrassed. I have a date with Edward Cullen. We're both juniors. I thought you  liked the Cullens.  Edward doesn't live in town. And  it's in the early stage and - whatever, he's outside right now. He wants to meet you. Officially.  Be nice, okay? He's... important. No fair, reading Charlie's mind.  And since when do vampires like baseball?  Now I get why you need the thunder. That has to be a home run. Yer out? I said, leave me alone!  Get out! It's over. I have to get out of this place.  Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now. I can't hurt him. No, Dad.  I broke up with him.  That's why I have to leave. I don't  want this. I want to go home. She'll come home. I'll call her  from the road. I want to drive. I need time to  think. I'll pull into a motel in  a  few hours. I promise. His face... I said the same words  my mother used when she left him.  If any of you get hurt because of me  I wish he'd call. They could get hurt. It's not  worth it. How do the visions work? Edward  said they weren't always certain.  So the course James is on now will  lead him to... a ballet studio? No. I don't know. I used to take  ballet lessons as a kid. The  school had an arch like that. Yeah, around the corner from my house.  But I haven't been there in ten years. No. Hell, no. I hated the place. Edward. Are you alright? No... we can't. When will you get here? Mom, I'm so glad you got my - Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine,  okay? I'll explain every  ... Mom? Are you there? Leave my mother out of this. I... don't think so. Where should I meet you? (taking a breath for  8th and Palo Verde, please. Everyone makes fun of me. Mom, I suck.  She's not here. Edward has nothing to do with this. No! Edward, don't.. .  It's on fire! My hand! It's burning! Life... is harder.. .  An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it,  confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus. RENE (O.S. Edward? Where's - RENE He's asleep. She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward sleeps. What... happened? Sounds like me. Mom, you're... texting. That's great mom. Mom, wait. I want to live in  Forks. I have Dad.. .  What do you think? Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad?  I  want to talk to him. Apologize. Is James - did you --  I'm alive because of you. But you did.  What? No! I want to be with you!  I  don't want  You really are trying to kill me. You're serious. At prom. Edward... why did you save me? If you'd let the venom spread,  I could've been like you by now. I want you. Always. I'm dying anyway. Every minute,  I get closer, older  Not the way Alice saw it.  I heard her. She saw me like you.  Based on what someone decides. And  I've decided. I dream about being with you forever.  Yes. Yes. For now. "
