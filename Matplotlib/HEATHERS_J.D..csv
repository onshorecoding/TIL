0,"There are no stupid questions. That's the stupidest question I've ever heard. Probably just row on out to the middle of a lake. Bring along my sax, some tequila, and some Bach. Definitely. It seems to have an open door policy for assholes though, doesn't it? I'll repeat myself. really did was ruin two pairs of pants...Maybe not even that... Can you bleach out urine stains? I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane. The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee? Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company? My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? ""Bringing every State to a Higher State."" Everybody's life's got static. Is your life perfect? I don't really like your friends either. Maybe it's time for a vacation. Dreadful etiquette. I apologize. I saw the croquet set-up in the back. Up for a match? Heather Chandler is one bitch that deserves to die. A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift. See the condoms in the grass over there. We killed tonight, Veronica. We murdered our baby. Just saying it's not hard to end a life. I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about. Good plan. Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue. I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself. Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue. Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking. Yeah, great. Chick-en. I'm sorry. Veronica knew you'd have a hangover. So I whipped this up. Family recipe. I knew this stuff would be too intense. Something tells me you picked up the wrong cup. And your worst enemy. What are we going to tell the cops? ""Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."" I'm just a little freaked, all right? You got what you wanted, you know. We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing..... Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion. ""To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."" This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss. That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school. ""I die knowing no one knew the real me."" pushes a button on the remote control, cutting the sound. Mute! Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now. Why son, I didn't hear you come in. That was the one with the wheat right? Thirty Fourth of July fireworks attached to the trunk. Arraigned but Acquitted. Veronica, Dad. Dad, Veronica. Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner. Nice. The last time I saw my Mom, she was waving out the window of a library in Texas. Right, Dad? What is this shit? Another fucking Heather. I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of superior tonight. Seven high schools in seven states and the only thing different was my locker combination. We've broke through the peer pressure cooker. So what if we had to kill Miss Popularity.. Our love is God. Let's get a Slurpee. Get crucial. We won't be using blanks this time. Do you take German? These are Ich Luge bullets. My grandfather snared a shitload of them in W.W. Two. They're like tranquilizers only they break the surface of the skin, enough to cause blood, but not any real harm. We shoot Kurt and Ram. Make it look like they shot each other. By the time Kurt and Ram regain consciousness, they'll be the laughingstock's of the school. The note's the punchline. How'd it turn out? Incredible similarity. Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word. They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce. It doesn't work on small animals! Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed. We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick. You know it. Oh man, I almost forgot. The one perfecto thing I picked up... Perrier water! This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress. Three. Did you miss him completely? Don't move! I'll get him back! Now! Remember he's left-handed. Faster! Of course. You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face. Did to. Did to. Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes. How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse? I was just making it more special. Greetings and salutations. She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes. You mean the time you blew Kurt Kelly's ass away! You kids are making too much damn noise. Never given the matter much thought. Liked my mother. They said her death was an accident. But she knew when the explosives were set to go off. She knew... Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi? Whoa! Amazing! It's the new BigFun video! We've made MTV. Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor. I don't know how to talk to you. Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you. Phase my ass! You'll be back! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back. Oh, I just had the nicest chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots? Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but... I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself. Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then. In the meantime, strength, And hey, there's a little gift. He turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast. Holy traumatic experiences, Batman. I'm sorry you felt you had to put yourself through all that shit. I told you it wouldn't...Hey, it's in the past already, right? Cute. So it's come to this. Heather Chandler did polls. I want you to do a Petition, as a favor, as the favor. Do you know the group Big Fun? Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock. Catch a movie? Miniature Golf? I could be up for that. I've already started underlining meaningful passages in Heather's copy of Catcher in the Rye, if you know what I mean. So are we on? I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back! Nice. It's got that Catcher-in-the-Ryey- I-hate-the-world-and-the-world-hates-me- so-let's-commit-suicide ambience. Give it a try, underline something. ""You say tomayto, I say tomahto. Let's call the whole thing off...Hold it! Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious... Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag. What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils? How's this? Can you see your fucking reflection? You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting? Perfecto. Man, I've even got a marked-up Catcher in the Rye. What else does a suicide need? If you'll excuse me...... I can't believe you did it. I was teasing. I loved you. Sure, I climbed up here to kill you, but first I was going to try and get you back. With amazing petition. It's a shame you can't see what our fellow students really signed. Listen. ""We students of Westerburg High will die. Today. Our burning bodies will be the ultimate protest to a society that degrades is. Fuck you all."" Not that subtle but neither's blowing up the school. Talk about your suicide pacts. When our school explodes tomorrow, it's going to be the kind of thing that infects a generation. A Woodstock for the 80's. Damn, we coulda toasted marshmallows together. Sorry tiger, I'm a little busy.... I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you! You didn't say Simon Says. Live by the sword... You think just because you started this thing, you can end it? You, really didn't think I'd, forget, forget, to disconnect the.... grabs her and throws her against the steel boiler room door. Fuck you! You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven. You're not listening. People are going to look at the ashes of Westerburg and say there's a school that self-destructed not because society didn't care, but because that school was society. Is that deep or what? I'll let you put it in your diary, babe. Free of charge. Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe? What? You really fucked me up, Veronica. You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean. Pretend I did blow up the school. All the schools. Now that you're dead, what are you gonna do with your life? "
