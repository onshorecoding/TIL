0,"How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's? I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about here. You can sing in an a Capella group. Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC. Or you get into a final club, exactly. I'm trying now. To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy? But you've seen guys who row crew, right? Okay, well.. they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one. The Phoenix is good. It's the same topic. Would you rather talk about something else? We can change the subject. It's about exclusivity. The final clubs. And that's how you distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc. The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best. Theodore. Hm. why would you ask me that? They're all hard to get into. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in. Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here. Everybody can do that. He likes meteorology. If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. You asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance, You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that's where I have the best chance. I just think you asked--the placement of where you asked the question-- Erica-- Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated. Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do speak in code. I'm saving I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs. Because they're exclusive. He was a member of the Porcellian and yes I do. I want to be straight forward and tell you that I think you should be a lot more supportive. If I get in I'll be taking you to the parties and you'll be meeting people that you wouldn't normally get to meet. You're my girlfriend. Is this a joke? You're breaking up with me? Take it easy. It was--Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink is that you used to sleep with the door guy. I'm from Westchester. I apologize, okay? Siddown. I'm sorry and I mean it.. Come on. You don't have to study. Let's just talk. Why? All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so you're not likely to--I wasn't making a comment on your parents--I was saying you go to B.U. You don't have to study. Because you go to B.U.! ERICA stares at him... And I'm sorry T don't have a rowboat. I don't need friends. You're really leaving. ERICA takes MARK's hand and looks at him tenderly.. Wardo. How did you know that? Oh yeah. I need you. No, I need the algorithm you used for the oil futures. We're ranking girls. To watch the bottom 200's heads explode. Let's write it. Just a Couple of people. The question is, who are they gonna send it to? It's not a coincidence. That's not what happened. No, back, I mean--That's--back at the bar with Erica Albright. She said all that? That I said that stuff to her? why would you even need to depose her? You think if I know she can make me look like a. jerk I'll be more likely-- --to settle, right? Then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath. People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly. MARK stays in his seat. MARYLIN, the attractive second year associate who's on Mark's legal team is still sitting too... about four seats down from Mark. Yes. Which part? I pointed-out some pretty gaping holes in your system. Four hours? Six months academic probation. They walk out onto-- No it couldn't. They made me apologize. To them. Over and over. No. Yeah. Did I insult your girlfriends? What can I do for you? Yeah, I've got a minute. No. Hi. Yeah . Yeah. An app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music. Microsoft. I didn't sell it. I uploaded it for free. Yeah. How's this different from MySpace or Friendster? Yeah. --is exclusivity, I'm in. I'm in. It was three or four years ago, I don't know what I said. I don't understand that question. The affirmative? It was called TheFacebook back then. I'm in the middle of two different lawsuits. I said I'd help. I wouldn't say I approached him. It was at a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi. The Jewish fraternity. It was Caribbean Night. I think I've come up with something. What? Yeah. You got punched by the Phoenix. Yeah. I don't want to stare at that loop of Niagara Falls which has absolutely nothing to do with the Caribbean. People came to Facemash in a stampede, right? It wasn't because I put up pictures of hot girls. You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls. It was because I put up pictures of girls that people knew. So if people Want to go on the internet and check out their friends, why can't I build a website that offers that? An online community of friends. Pictures, profiles, whatever you can click into, visit, browse around. All from the privacy of your dorm room. I'm not talking about a dating site. I'm talking about taking the entire social structure of college and putting it online. I know, I'm totally pumped about this. --it would be exclusive. You'd have to know the people on the site to get in. Like getting punched. Like our own Final club except not only can we get into this one, we're the president. We're gonna need a little start-up cash to rent'the servers and get it online. We'll split it 70-30. 70 for me and 30 for you for putting up a thousand dollars and handling everything on the business end. You'll be CFO. It probably was a. diversity thing but so what? They're suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo and began a plan to screw him out of the company. Jealous of Eduardo? Ma'am, I know you've done your homework and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life, but at the moment I could buy Harvard University, take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my ping pong -room. I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache webserver with a mySQL backend. It's gonna cost a little more money. Two-hundred more. To handle the traffic. I already did. Good job. You should be proud of that right there, don't worry if you don't make it any further. Do you see any of your code on Facebook? Did I use any of your code? Match-dot-com for Harvard guys? You know you really don't need a damn forensic team to get to the bottom of this. If you guys were the inventors of Facebook you'd have invented Facebook. No shit. I have to add a feature. It's clean and simple. No flashing lights. The CAMERA surveys the screen as MARK slips through some functions to show EDUARDO and we see things that are now familiar--A photo, sex, a profile, a list of attributes, a poke application, etc. But watch. MARK's called up a the Emacs program and quickly writes out several lines of code... ""Relationship Status"", ""Interested In"". --get laid. Yes. It's ready. Yeah. It's ready, that was it. And here's the masthead, MARK hits another couple of keystrokes and the website's masthead comes up. Yeah. Yeah. Sure I do. Right now. Get your laptop out. Because you've got e-mails for everyone at the Phoenix. It's not Spam. If we send it to our friends it'll just bounce around the computer lab, These guys know people and these guys know girls. I need their e-mails. Let's start with the president. Like the Lewis Carrol? These guys. Think they're literary geniuses because the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in their-- I'm just saying. It's not important to you. I had no idea whether they came from money or not. or roughly the amount I paid in income tax last year, go on. They made a point of pointing that out. Yes. I hadn't heard, tell me more. They want to have drinks later. Yeah. Sure. Thanks. How you doin'. I doubt it. Those Asian girls were cute. What were their names? When? What does that mean? No I know what the word means. I'm asking how do you want to do it? No. What were their names? 'Cause theFacebook is cool. If we start installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's We don't even know what it is yet. We don't know what it is, what it can be, what it will be. We know it'•s cool, that's a -priceless asset and we're not giving it up. EDUARDO is sitting at MARK's desk and he's seen something sitting on top of a pile of'books.,, What, EDUARDO holds up a letter that's on a lawyer's stationary. I think it's called a cease and desist letter. What were their names? About 10 days ago. Right after we launched the site. I liked th shorter one. I find that to be mildly annoying. It was addressed to me. What? I'm not. What are you, my mother? No, it says I could face legal action. The lawyer is their father's house counsel, I checked it out, they're not, Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool. and popular and sexy and HarvardConnection is lame. I didn't use any of their code, I didn't use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn.'t owe money to everyone who,,, ever built a chair. Th ey came to me with an idea, I had a better one. I didn't think. it was a big deal.. No, I went to a 3-L at Student Legal services and he told me to write them back. I'd raised concerns before. Yeah. No. It just started snowing. No. What. I had to swear an oath before we began the deposition phase and I don't want to get arrested for perjury so I have a legal obligation to say no. I'll be right back. Erica? ERICA, from the opening scene, turns her head and looks up to see MARK. She's looking sexy for her Friday ni.ght on the town and the three guys she's with are studs. A few more friends of theirs are standing around at the edges of the booth. I saw you from over there. I didn't know you came to this club a lot. Mine too. It's not bad. It's not. great. The music's kind of lame. Could I talk to you alone for a second? okay. MARK is aware of everyone else around the booth. ThePacebook? I'm really sorry about that. That's why I came over. I don't want to. Okay. I think you're wrong. We have to expand. And MARK heads out the door. EDUARDO watches MARK and then looks back at the girls and answers the un-asked question-- and EDUARDO are waiting and JENNY and ALICE are sitting on the bed. Everyone's got a beer. Once the door is closed-- We're expanding theFacebook to Yale and Columbia. Dustin, I want you to share. the coding work with me. Chris, you're going to be in charge. of publicity and outreach. You can start by getting a story about the expansion in the B.U. student newspaper. Because I do. Here's the business arrangement. Eduardo's CFO and owns 30% of the company, Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end. Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing. Any questions? No. That's it. Yale and Columbia, let's go. What? No thank you. who are you? I mean what do you do? Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia. I wasn't asleep. They're not gonna card us. Are you gonna talk about ads again? This isn't a business. He's a god, he can be as late as he wants. What is he? He also founded'the companies. He's here. SEAN PARKER has stepped into the restaurant and is. saying hello to the hostess while hugging a waitress. Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but Baylor already had a social network on campus so instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within a hundred miles and put theFacebook on those campuses first. Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site and we were in. Exactly. I said exactly that. You want to end the party at eleven. There won't be a party unless it's cool. I meant catching the marlin instead of the 1.4 trout. Doesn't that sound good? They identify you as-- --one of the founders of Facebook. ""Junior Eduardo Saverin, co-founder of Facebook, wa.s-- --I'm not the expert but being connected to torturing animals is probably bad for business. This is scathing. I'm gonna have to answer for this. Alright, let's just forget about it. T. have my final coming up for ""Postwar and Contemporary Art"" and I haven't been to class. I'm supposed to write about those four paintings. Yeah, I opened it under an alias. I posted the paintings and asked people to comment. Every once in a while I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going, it's beautiful. We're gonna need more money, Wardo. ---and I want to hit that coal by the end of the summer. I'm interviewing people tomorrow--two interns to come to Palo Alto for the summer and we're-gonna have to pay them something. I already found a house for rent on a street two-blocks.from the Stanford campus. It's a piece of junk but it's perfect and it's got a pool. He was right. California's the place we've gotta be. What's your problem with Sean? He's got connections to the VCs. The real players and-- --as someone who's just really embarrassed the company in a bad way-- Bang on. 150,000 members, Wardo. Congratulations. Who came up with nothing. We don't know any of that's true. And you can read about you torturing birds. I'm interviewing interns at 10 tomorrow night in t}y CS lab. Get on board with this or not. They have 10 minutes to get 'root access to a Python webserver, expose its SSL encryti_on and then intercept all traffic over its secure port. All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. But here's the beauty. Every 10th line of code written, they have to drink a shot. And hacking's supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to drink a shot. I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers--the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot. Plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot. What's this? welcome to Facebook. The place ERUPTS. The pretty ASIAN GIRL hits an mp3 player that's been hooked up to speakers and a Dr. Dre song blares out--""California, it's time to party..."" The two winners are hugging each other and getting wild congratulations from the crowd. Hang on. MARK's scratching something out on a pad... You sure? Is anything broken? I didn't know we had a doorbell. Andrew. Good boy. MARK gets to the door and opens it. He's stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his girlfriend, SHARON. They all look at each other for a moment--- Sean? Yeah. Do you? Yeah. No. You live across the street. Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool. Yeah. He's wired in. He's got an internship in New York. I still can't believe I rented a house across the street from you. Your date looks so familiar to me, What do you mean? I know everything there is to know about you Sean. He has an internship. In New York. Yes. We want: to . be in a hundred schools. Yeah. Wardo. What time is it? You've gotta see some of the new stuff we've got. Dustin, show him the wall. I'm just calling it the wall. Thiel may want to make an angel, investment. You've had a long flight. Sure. How's it going? How's the internship? How's Jenny? Yeah. I do remember you saying that. How's Jenny? That can be fun. Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend. You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it's all happening. The con etions, the energy- --the creativity. We've got over 300,000 members, we're in --five in Europe. We need more servers than I ever imagined we'd need. We need more programmers. We need more'money. He set uV the Thiel meeting. He's set up meetings all around town. Yes. You're in New York! How's it going so far?!! EDUARDO looks at MARK for a long moment before we and SEAN are waiting--seated side by side--for a verdict. SEAN's wearing his best Prada, MARK's wearing his hoodie and Adidas flip-flops. After a moment... You froze our account? in the background there's a small celebration going on with SEAN, DUSTIN, the INTERNS and of course some GIRLS. Champagne is being sprayed from shaken bottles and the girls. are dancing to triumphant music. Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company? Do you realize that your actions could have easily destroyed everything I've been working on? Without money, the company can't function. What EDUARDO can't see behind his back is that JENNY has taken the gift box and lit it on fire with a cigarette lighter. Even a small exodus, even a few people leaving would reverberate through the whole user base. The users are interconnected, that's the whole fucking point! College kids are online because their friends are online and if one --goes, all the dominos go! Do you get that?! I'm not going back to Caribbean Night at the Jewish fraternity! Did you like being nothing?! Did you like being nobody?! Did you like being a pasty- faced geek?! You wanna go back to that?! That was the act'of a child, not a businessman. And it certainly wasn't the act of a friend, You know how embarrassed I was when I tried to cash a check? And I was with a girl, Wardo. It happened in front of a girl. I'm not going back to that life, Okay, maybe you were angry, maybe you were frustrated. I'm ready to let, uh, to let bygones be bygones because I've got some good news. EDUARDO--with the fire now out--picks up the phone. I said I've got some good news. Peter Thiel's just made an angel investment of a half a million dollars.. A half a million dollars and he's setting us up in an office. They want to re- incorporate the company, they want to meet you and they need your signature on some documents so get your ass on the next flight back to San Francisco. I need my CFO, EDUARDO clicks the phone shut. Yeah. Yeah. You sure about-this? You were told that if new investors came You signed the papers. You're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company?! That's right. It is. Maybe if you'd spent a little less time with your new friends and a little more time with the company Yeah. No. You didn't have to be that rough on him. Sean? You didn't have to be that rough on him. Ashleigh? That's great. I've been, you know, I've been talking to her a little. I don't know, I think she likes me. What? You can put it on my desk. ASHLEIGH puts the small package on Mark's desk. You'd do that for me? MACKEY hits the ""refresh"" key and the big screen shows-- Go home, Sean. I'll call our people. MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment. He looks at the small package. that Ashleigh dropped on his desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there's a box. He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He takes one of the business cards out and looks at it. I'm CEO ...Bitoh And over this we HEAR a woman's voice... My lawyer or their lawyer? I'm not a bad guy. What happens now? They're gonna want to settle? Why? I invented Facebook. Likability? You think I'm the one who called the police? I was drunk and angry and stupid. Would anyone mind it I stayed and used the computer for a minute? Thanks. I appreciate your help today, "
