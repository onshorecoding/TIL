Did he? 11. When I unpack them in my club. No. Who wants to tapas while they samba? I don't want to meet anyone. Uh-huh. Does she like jazz? Then what are we gonna talk about? Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart of gold.   12. How long's it been? I am serious. I had a very serious plan for my future. It's not my fault I got Shanghai'ed. What's the difference? Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty word? You're acting like life's got me on the ropes -- what you don't understand is, I want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope. I'm changing the locks.    13. I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes! Bill. Thanks for having me back. Of course. (under his breath as he heads Though I don't think they care what I play. How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me? Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal. There's a nice way to say that. I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- You're not gonna find a better player. You know that. Ok. I remember you. Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.    18. But requesting ""I Ran"" from a serious musician -- it's too far. I don't think so. Why? So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything? Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. He doesn't tell me what to do. I let him.       19. Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies. You again. ...Yeah.    20. ...Which one is it? Those look comfortable. You didn't give me much of a choice. It is strange. Maybe it means something. Yeah I don't think so either.     21. It turns your head into an antenna. Probably gives you cancer, but you find your car more quickly. You don't live as long, but you get things done faster, so it all evens out. Not much to look at. No, that's fine... Thanks... Meetings. Studio heads.    24. Piece of cake. Great. I'll hide in the bathroom. What's your Bogart's name...? Is it Greg? How long have...? I know what you mean. I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club. It was called Van Beek. The swing bands played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb. It's a samba-tapas place now. Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on history. I know. They shoot movies on my street. ""C-stands."" ""Apple box."" ""Don't forget to sign out."" How'd you get into all this?       26. Who would you invite to watch? Your parents? ...`Cause the world needs more lawyers. You're not just an actress. You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright. You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are. All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history. Yeah?    28. What does that mean? ""I hate jazz""? But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying ""I hate animals"". Do you need to be anywhere right now? ...What? It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note!        29. Mia. These are things you can't unsay. ...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm getting the lease back. It'll be perfect. Really? For what? Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.? That's amazing! ""I got the bulletsssss!"" What? You're the movie person. Come on. You can't do this audition and never see Rebel. The theater near me's playing it. If you want -- I can take you. For research. 10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool? Keith?    41. This is Mia. Mia, Keith. We used to play together. Great. You? Good for you. I'm good. I'm good. You bet. It's beautiful. No... I'm not. That's the point. Fuck `em. I truly believe it. I'll be front-row. What's that? Why does it say ""Seb's""? Never. You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name ""Bird"" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. ""Chicken on a Stick"". It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history. Your play's incredible. ...Which guy? You mean Keith? He's the worst. It's always weird with him. Right... No. Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- -- and your play is going to be a triumph. Well... Here I am. Yeah, that...that... ...sounds good. You're holding onto the past. But jazz is about the future. Surprise. How's the play going? Why? Fuck `em! They should be so lucky to see it. It's going to be incredible. I can't wait. 6:45. Yep. Boise. You should come. Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list. Why can't you? Yeah. Can't you rehearse anywhere? ...I -- I guess... Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other. ...What do you mean? But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour. ...What does that mean? What did you think I was going to do? You didn't think we'd be successful. Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record. I don't know how that matters. Do you like the music I'm playing? Yeah, well, I -- What are you doing? Why are you doing this? This is what you wanted from me. To have a steady job. So I'm doing that. So why aren't we celebrating? You said yourself no one wants to go to that club! No one wants to go to a club called Chicken on a Stick -- -- and no one likes jazz. Not even you.      59. What am I supposed to do? Go back to playing ""Jingle Bells"" so I can save money for some Shangri-La club no one wants to go to? Not in my experience. This is the dream! Guys like me go their whole lives and never do anything that's liked. I'm finally doing something that people enjoy. What is wrong with that? You're an actress, who are you to talk?? No. ...Tonight? I thought that was next Thursday. Mia! I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you -- ...What do you mean? You didn't embarrass yourself...  65. ...This is home. Oh God, I didn't see them. You look beautiful. I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while. Yes ma'am. ...You still think New York? What...? Wrong number. Yeah, well...not anymore. I won't. ""Casting""...?   68. Because I have good news. Amy Brandt. The casting director. She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got. ...Excuse me? That's it? So you're happy here? Why won't you come? I don't buy it. Because what? Yes you are. Why? Why don't you want to do it anymore? I told them you'd be there at five-thirty tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I drive back at eight. Either you'll be outside or you won't. The house across from the library. When do you find out? You're going to get it. You are. I know these things. Griffith Park. I know... I don't know. I don't think we can do anything. Because when you get this -- When you get this -- you've got to give it everything you've got. I've got to follow my own plan. Stay here. Get my own thing going. You know... I guess we're just going to have to wait and see. I'm always going to love you too. Agreed. Alright, I'm done. Harris did a nice job with it. No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels. How'd we do last month? Not too bad is great. (taps the Employee on the See you tonight. Hothouse Eddie -- miss me? Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh? Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen. I don't know, I told him to play ""Jingle Bells"". "
