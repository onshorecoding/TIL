0,"Freeze! FBI! Never cock. Just squeeze. What'd I do? Good morning, Mr. Crawford. I hope so. They haven't posted  anything. Not yet. Who's the subject? The cannibal... Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad  for the chance, sir, but - why me? Yes sir. And what is that, sir? I'm sure it's a great town, Dr.  Chilton, but my instructions are to  talk to Lecter and report back this  afternoon. How do you mean, Dr. Chilton? I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor.  It's not a charm school. I understand. Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're  his enemy - as you've said - then  maybe I'll have more luck by myself.  What do you think? But then I would've missed the  pleasure of your company. Clarice Starling. Yes, he did. Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice  Starling. May I talk with you? Doctor, we have a hard problem in  psychological profiling. I want to  ask for your help with a  questionnaire. I am, yes. I'm - still in training at the  Academy. We're talking about psychology,  Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide  for yourself whether or not I'm  qualified? He said - ""I can smell your cunt."" Yes. Maybe they'll catch up. Did you do those drawings, Doctor? All that detail, just from memory...? Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider - I'm only asking you to look at this,  Doctor. Either you will or you won't. No, I came because we need - Five... so far. Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's  an active case, I'm not involved. If - I'll tell you if you'll look at this  form. (he considers, then  It started as a bad joke in Kansas  City Homicide. They said... this one  likes to skin his humps. It excites him. Most serial killers  keep some sort of trophies. No. You ate yours. No. I only hoped that your knowledge - You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are  you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself? How  about it...? Look at yourself and  write down the truth. (she slams the tray  Or maybe you're afraid to. Reasonably so. Yes. And the questionnaire...? Then please - do this test for me. What's that, Dr. Lecter? Thanks, Ardelia. Pleading with a crazy man, with come  all over my face. Mr. Crawford? It's all there, sir, practically  verbatim. Right down to the kleenex I used. Sir, why? Is something wrong? I spent all evening on the mainframe.  Lecter altered or destroyed most of  his patient histories, prior to  capture. No record of anyone named  Mofet. But ""Split City"" sounded like  it might have have something to do  with divorce. I tracked it down in  the library's catalogue of national  yellow pages. It's a mini-storage facility outside  Baltimore, where Lecter had his  practice. Sir, that's a field job. It's outside  the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on - To complete and file my report by  0800 Wednesday. But sir - Sir, what is it? There's something  you're not telling me. Murdered...? How? I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know  how to feel about it. Well God damn it! You old creep.  Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs  squirt you and see how you like it. So no one's been in here since -  I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I  promise. Be gone before you know it. Would you hold these, please? Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else -  would you be kind enough to call  this number? It's our Baltimore field  office. They know you're here with  me... Do you understand? Good idea. Okay, Mr. Yow... That wasn't me. Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks  like somebody is sitting in this  car. Not yet! - just wait for me. Maybe in about two seconds. Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas  anymore. Hester Mofet... ""The rest of me.""  Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you  rented that place. You put those - things in there.  Paid for it in advance, ten years  ago... Why, Dr. Lecter? Thank you. How did - It's nothing. A scratch. Why? Do you know something about  him? Why don't you tell me about ""Miss  Mofet?"" You wanted me to find him.  Or do I have to wait for the lab? If you didn't kill him, then who  did? Wouldn't it have been easier to just  leave him for the police to find? Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated. Because you weren't wasting my time. I don't know. Next time I'll have to  check. I never thought about it. That doesn't interest me, Doctor.  And it's the sort of thing Miggs  would ask. I don't know. Is it? Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You  know, don't you? Who killed your patient? Buffalo Bill...? Bill killed him, all those years  ago...? That's impossible. Where? I'll need the big fingerprint kit...  and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries. Sometimes. I will... I promise. There's no correlation at all between  where they're kidnapped and where  they're found...? What if - what if you trace the  heaviest-traffic routes backwards  from the dump sites? Do they converge  at all? (choosing her words  He's a white male... Serial killers  tend to hunt within their own ethnic  group. And he's not a drifter - he's  got his own house, somewhere. Not an  apartment. What he does with them - takes  privacy... Time, tools... He's in  his 30's or 40's - he's got real  physical strength, but combined with  an older man's self-control. He's  cautious, precise, never impulsive...  This won't end in suicide, like they  often do. He's got a real taste for it now.  And he's getting better at his work. Like I have a ""knack"" for Dr. Lecter? You haven't said a word today about  that garage. Or what I found there. You knew. You knew from the start  that Lecter held the key to this...  But you weren't up front with me.  You sent me in to him naked. He starts this - buzzing in me, in  my head. He makes me feel violated...  You used me, Mr. Crawford. Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen!  Listen here a minute, please. There's  things I need to do for her... Bill... Well, she's not local. Her ears are  pierced three times each, and she's  wearing green glitter nail polish.  Looks like town to me... Two of the fingernails are broken  off, and there's - dirt or grit under  the others. She tried to claw her  way through something... I'll scrape  out samples after I've printed her. Think they were runnin' a trotline? It's a Fish and Game violation. Like  poaching. There's a big fine. They do it lots of places. She's got something in her throat. I don't know. I didn't see those on  any of the other girls... Thanks, I'm not thirsty. It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other  cops know who you are. They look at  you to see how to act... It matters. I'm wondering if he's done that before -  placed a cocoon, or an insect. It  would be easy to miss in an autopsy,  especially with a floater... Can we  check back on that? Then have the lab check Raspail's  head. Dr. Lecter's patient - have them  probe his soft-palette tissues...  They'll find another cocoon. Raspail was killed by the same man  who's killing these girls. And Lecter  knows him. Maybe even treated him...  You think so, too, don't you? Or  you'd never have sent me to that  asylum. Boy, is that smart... Somebody's coaching her... They're  trying to make him see Catherine as  a person - not just an object. You really don't want to know. I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher. Not lately. But maybe someday. You're sure? And there's no way - no natural way -  these could've wound up in the bodies? Dr. Lecter... He's already offered to help... What  would happen if we just showed our  cards - asked him for Bill? But if he knew we have so little  time - I think he means it, this time. I  think he'll deal. Transfer to a new prison. With a  view of trees, he said, or even  water... Can we swing that? You'll back me up with some paperwork? Then I'll try. But wouldn't this  have more weight coming from the  Senator herself? Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is  just routine follow-up on the Raspail  case. I'm acting on instruction, Dr.  Chilton. This is the U.S. Attorney's number.  Now please - either discuss this  with him, or let me do my job. I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You  chose to speak to me. Would you prefer  someone else now? Or perhaps you  don't think you can help us. By the book, he's a sadist. Yes. They all were. She had an insect deliberately  inserted in her throat. That hasn't  been made public yet. We don't know  what is means. (pause; staring at  A moth... How did you predict that? If you help us find Buffalo Bill in  time to save Catherine Martin, the  Senator promises you a transfer to  the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park,  New York, with a view of the woods  nearby. Maximum security still  applies, but you'd have reasonable  access to books. Best of all, though - one week a  year you'd get to leave the hospital  and go here. Plum Island. Every afternoon of that  week you can walk on the beach or  swim in the ocean for up to one hour.  Under SWAT team surveillance, of  course... Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file,  copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her  offer is final and non-negotiable.  If Catherine dies - (she slides his tray  You get nothing. That's just part of the island. It  has a very nice beach. Terns nest  there. Go, Doctor. The death of my father. He was a town marshal... one night  he surprised two burglars, coming  out the back of a drugstore... They  shot him. No. He was strong, he lasted almost  a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become -  the whole world to me... After he  left me, I had nobody. I was ten  years old. Quid pro quo, Doctor. Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation  in the literature between  transsexualism and violence.  Transsexuals are very passive. No. Tell me why. I went to live with my mother's cousin  and her husband in Montana. They had  a ranch. Horses - and sheep... Two months. I - ran away... No. No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor. You said - I was very close to the  way we'd catch him. On what basis would they reject him? How would he test? Yes, Doctor. Please. Chilton has killed her, hasn't he?  That slimy little bastard! We were  so close with Lecter - and now her  last chance is gone. Are you in trouble over this, Mr.  Crawford? Can Senator Martin do  something to you? If you didn't want me chasing him,  you shouldn't have taken me to that  funeral home. Lecter is still the key, I know he  is. Whatever he told me about Bill  is just as good now as it was before. I lied to Lecter. I'll need some  kind of peace offering... Can I get  the drawings from his cell? Mr. Crawford... can those cops down  there handle Dr. Lecter? I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI. Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me - I need the ID to fly with my gun.  The gun belongs in Quantico. Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts  me. Or at least, he used to. If I  could just - Sir, doesn't this ""William Rubin""  strike you as - I don't know - kind  of vague? Yes sir. I can find it by myself. I just left him. I don't have a name for what he is. Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned  him before. I thought you might want your drawings  back... Just until you get your view. Nobody sent me. I came on my own. Dr. Lecter, you find out everything.  You couldn't have talked with this  ""William Rubin"", even once, and come  out knowing so little about him...  You made him up, didn't you? I think you were telling me the truth  in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell  me the rest now. Then tell me how. He kills w- Anger, social resentment, sexual  frus- No. We just - All right, then tell me how - Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll - Later, listen, I'll - And - one morning I just - ran away... Early. Still dark. Yes...! They were screaming. No. First I tried to free them... I  opened the gate of their pen - but  they wouldn't run. They just stood  there, confused. They wouldn't run... I took one lamb. And I ran away, as  fast as I could... Yes... Yes! I don't know...! I don't know. Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter. (moving closer to the  Yes. I'll tell you. No. He won't come after me. It would be rude. And he wouldn't  get to ask any more questions... The worst part - the thing that's  making me crazy - is that Bill is  right in front of me. Only I can't  see him... (touching the case  Lecter said, everything I need to  catch him is right here, in these  pages... He's here, Ardelia. ""Desperately random."" What does he  mean? But there is no pattern. There's no  connection at all among these places,  or the computers would've nailed it!  They're even found in random order. What girl? Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere,  Ohio. The first girl taken, but the  third body found... Why? But why? He didn't weight the others. The first, what the hell did Lecter  say about... ""First principles,"" he  said. Simplicity... What does this  guy do, he ""covets."" How do we first  start to covet? ""We covet what we  see -"" ""- every day."" Maybe he lives in this, this  Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw  her every day, and killed her sort  of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant  to... give her a 7-Up and talk about  the choir. But then - But then he had to cover up, make  her seem just like all the rest of  them. That's what Lecter was hinting! All his victims are women... His  obsession is women, he lives to hunt  women. But not one women is hunting  him - except me. I can walk in a  woman's room and know three times as  much about her as a man would. I have to go to Belvedere. You do until six p.m. But not from this angle. Not thinking  he knew her. You've got to send me! But I just became a private citizen.  I can go anywhere I want to. He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford.  This morning, or maybe at noon, but  today, and Belvedere's our last  chance. I'm flying there, right now,  unless you stop me. You want my ID?  Here - take it... Thank you. Mr. Bimmel...?  Sewing darts. You bastard. He's making himself a ""woman suit,""  Mr. Crawford - out of real women!  And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor - That's why they're all so big -  because he needs a lot of skin! He  keeps them alive to starve them awhile -  to loosen their skin, so that - Where? Sir, that's great news. But how - Sewing... Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in - Yes sir... I'll do my best. Yes sir. Thank you, sir... Mr. Bimmel... did Fredrica ever  mention a man named Jamie Gumb, from  Calumet City? Or John Grant? Did she know any men that sew? Who was her best friend, Mr. Bimmel?  Who'd she hang out with? Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a  man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant? (Stacy shakes her  Do you think she could've had a friend  you didn't know about? Did you ever work with her? Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd  like to talk to her. I think so. Sometimes you do. Good afternoon... I wonder if you  could help me. I'm looking for Mrs.  Lippman's family? Excuse me, but I really do need to  talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's  house. Did you know her? I'm investigating the death of  Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please? Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica  when she worked for Mrs. Lippman? Thanks. I think we may be, yes. Mr. Gordon, did you take over this  place after Mrs. Lippman died? Did she leave any records here? Tax  or business records? Maybe a list of  employees? No... no, we don't. Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you  have a phone I can use? Freeze! Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under  arrest. Down on the floor, hands and  legs spread, move it. Shit! FBI, Catherine, you're safe. You're all right! Where is he? I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I  can hear. Shut that dog up. Is there a ladder? Is there a rope? Catherine. Listen to me. I have to  find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but - Shut UP! The other officers will be here any  minute! you're perfectly safe now! Agent Mapp! Thank you! Starling. Where are you, Dr. Lecter? Dr. Lecter - Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...! "
