0,"Hey guys, can I play? Wow! He talks! Hey Teddy... can I tell you something nobody knows? Teddy? Teddy?! Did you... did you just talk? You're alive?! Whoa... Yeah, I... I did wish for it. You mean... we get to be best friends... for real? Forever and ever? Mom! Dad! Guess what?! My teddy bear's alive! No mom, he's alive! For real! Look! BUT DAD-- Dad, no! Yeah, Dad! I made a wish last night that Teddy was alive, and my wish came true! Teddy? Do you promise we'll always be together? Thunder buddies for life. CONTINUED: That's bullshit, what about Lori? She's hot. They're not that bad. I-- It's workin' for me. Yeah, I don't know that you wanna go to a drug dealer with complaints. Oh fuck, is it nine-thirty? Shit, I gotta get to work. Aw, man. It's not good. Shit. I know, I'm sorry, it wasn't my fault. THOMAS What do you mean? I guess I... wasn't really prepared for a follow-up question. Sir, I promise, you're not gonna regret promoting the fuck out of me. N--no. No. Wowwww. I will, sir. Thank you. I won't let you down, Goose. Top Gun. Tom Skerritt. Jesus, Guy, you look like shit, what happened? And you don't remember it? It... it just seems gay, doesn't it? Do you think you're part of some, like, gay beat-up underworld? Like one of those gay beat-up clubs? Hey Alix. / Hey, how was the club last night? Hey guys, does anybody know a nice restaurant? Like something where the napkins are cloth? Lori and I have been dating four years tomorrow, and I wanted to take her someplace nice. Yeah. Wow, you're... not very tolerant, huh. GUY Lori ever fart in front of you? Yes. Yes. Many times. No. GUY Oh. Why? Like what? Oh come on, nobody's expecting anybody to propose. Marriage isn't... I mean, isn't love enough? I submit that love is enough. So bad, but so good. Oh, I love this part. HE'S FOR EVERY ONE OF US! TED STAND FOR EVERY ONE OF US! HE'LL SAVE WITH A MIGHTY HAND/EVERY MAN EVERY WOMAN EVERY CHILD WITH A MIGHTY FLASH! I can't, I'm taking Lori to dinner. Well, we've been dating four years tomorrow. Lemme ask you something... you don't think she's gonna be expecting something... big, do you? No, like... a circular gold thing on the finger. Stop it! Jesus Christ, knock it off! He throws Ted off of him. I guess I didn't think about that. This is the American fantasy, right here. A professional NFL player is called upon to save the world. Tom Brady could do that. The front door opens and LORI, an attractive girl in her mid to late 20's, enters holding several grocery bags. Hey, sweetie. What do we got there? Whoa!!! She's a comedienne. She's as pretty as she is funny. How was work? LORI Good. How's your dickhead boss? I'm not saying this to be mean, but I really hope that fucker gets leukemia. Oh yeah, a coupla' Charles Brew-Kowskis? Maybe a Mike Brew-ga-slow-ski? It doesn't work, the name has to have a ""ski"" at the end of it. You just put ""brewski"" on the end of Martina Navratolova. They did? What happened? You know, if your leg got trapped under a rock, I'd chew it off to get you free. I sure would. Is that cannibalism? Oh yeah, no, I don't swallow. It's not true, I'm a fuckin' classy broad. You kiddin' me? Four years we been going out, I'm takin' you to the best place in town. I been crappin' out room for it for two days, I know exactly what I'm gonna order. And you get to pick any bottle of wine. Any bottle of 2012 wine. They are in and they. Are. Fresh. Ah, come on! I am not. We hear another thunderclap. Ted runs into the room with no warning and leaps into bed, right between Lori and John. Actually, could you wrap just this up for me? I wanna scare the shit outta somebody. Yeah, but I read at a six year-old level. It's a special night. We've been dating for four years. And hey, all those rich black people can't be wrong, right? (affectionately taking her No, it doesn't. Oh my god, are you okay? Oh god, I'm so sorry! CONTINUED: Oh Jesus, I'm so so sorry! I didn't see you! It was an accident! Did you hurt your head? Oh, man. Here, let me get you some ice. I'm... I'm John. LORI I'm Lori. Octopussy. But does that show that I care about you, or I care about Roger Moore? Thank you. And by the way, my dancing was not that bad. LORI Your dancing was bad. I had some cool moves. That's not how I remember it. Hey, here's to four more years, huh? --But, I got you something anyway, in clear violation of the ""no gift"" rule. Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for a long time. Those are the ones you liked, right? From that kiosk at the mall? LORI Oh. Yeah. Check out the card. Oh wow, a Hamilton! Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is so awesome, I love it! She reacts a bit to this. I know, but it's important to me that you have the engagement ring you deserve. And what with the credit bubble... the Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti. LORI Look, I'm only saying this because I love you, but that's not realistic. You're never gonna have any kind of a career if you're always partying and wasting time with Ted. Oh, Jesus, here we go-- Look, can we talk about this another time, and just enjoy our anniversary dinner? CONTINUED: (rolling his eyes with a Lori, we can't talk about this every time we go out. Look, he's been my best friend since I was eight. And I was not a popular child. You have to understand, I had no friends before he came along. He's the only reason I ever gained any fucking confidence. I coulda wound up like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know, I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick him out. I love you, too. You know that. Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna be even better. `Cause I can have sex with you, and press your arm fat against a comic book so I can see it backwards. I can do it all with one hand. I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller. Well, I hope these jokes have distracted you from the actual problems in our relationship. I dunno, I got a lotta fuckin' jokes. Ah shit, hang on, my phone fell under the seat somewhere. Can you call it? Oh, yeah... No, it's from The Notebook. Found my phone. Yeah. Ted... you gotta move out. It's... it's gotta happen. Ted sits down on a bench, a little stunned and dazed. Ted, my relationship is at a very delicate stage, and, y'know, Lori and I may just need a little space right now. Plus a hooker took a shit in our apartment. Aaaa, what?! Don't tell me, I don't wanna hear about it! Did you get it? Tell me when you get it! AAAAA! You can never cook with that hand again! I'm serious, learn to cook other- handed! I'll get the next one, okay? Yes. But, that doesn't mean we can't hang out. We'll hang out all the time! I know. Fuck. I just don't know what to do here. I know it sucks, but otherwise I'm gonna lose her. And I do love her, Ted. I'll help you get on your feet out there, I promise. Fuck, all the time. That was the-- the thing-- The old-- Yeah-- no, I know- that doesn't mean-- I'm not - gay. We've got to get you a job. No, you don't. You look dapper. Look, I know it sucks, but you gotta make some money so you can pay for an apartment. Well, you have no skills. As I said, you would need a law degree from a law school. Look, you get the job, and we'll celebrate after. Probably, yes. Oh. Um, thank you. I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't for sale. I've had him since I was about your age. He's very special to me. Ew, why the fuck did he say that? Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff. Oh man, I can totally see him just taking you down to the basement and really slowly de-limbing you while singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme. Well... I guess this is it, huh? First night on your own. Okay... so... if you need anything... CONTINUED: Seriously, anything... I know you will, buddy. Hey. Hey, anything for you. This is all part of the new grown up, adult John Bennett. So, get used to him. (guiding her down onto the Ooh, that's perfect, I'm only gonna need one. Most guys don't have you to motivate `em. No, you were right! Look, the reason I love you so much is the same reason I guess I take you for granted sometimes. It's `cause you're... inevitable. No, what I mean is, there's just no version of this universe where you and I don't end up together. You're inevitable. But do you get what I'm saying? Oh, I'm all right. Just... getting used to things, that's all. Really? Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost our furry little guy. Hey, Ted. I could probably swing by after work. I can't just ditch work, man. Look, I'm trying to get my shit together and be an adult here, y'know? For Lori's sake. Really? Sometimes adults get high. You'll kick me out in five. John, I have to kick you out. I am extraordinarily busy today, I have so much teddy bear paperwork to get through, it is retarded. Five minutes and you're outta here. What do I tell Thomas? I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried to break up a dog fight, and I guess she got hurt pretty bad. Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she sees trouble, she tries to help out, and I guess one of these dogs clamped his jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let go until the fireman showed up and had to stick his finger in his ass. Yeah, she's pretty shook up. Yeah, that's how they-- Yeah. Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one. You know, he's exactly who you want him to be. What is it? That doesn't sound very mellow. Y'know, this place looks great. How are the neighbors? That's lucky. Sucks. You? No way, that's awesome. We should double date, you, me Lori and, what's her name? Uh, Mandy? Madison? Britney, Tiffany, Candice? TED Nope. Don't fuck with me on this. I know this shit. Okay, Brandi, Heather, Channing, Breanna, Amber, Sabrina, Melody, Dakota, Sierra, Bambi, Crystal, Samantha, Autumn, Ruby, Taylor, Tara, Tamra, Tami, Lauren, Charlene, Chantel, Courtney, Misty, Jenna, Krista, Mindy, Noelle, Shelby, Trina, Reba, Cassandra, Nikki, Kelsey, Shawna, Jolene, Earline, Claudine, Savannah, Kasey, Dolly, Kendra, Carla, Chloe, Devon, Emmylou, Becky? Okay, was it any one of those names with a Lynn after it? Okay. Brandi-Lynn, Heather-Lynn-- Fuck! Hey, well... it sounds like everything worked out then. Lori's a senior VP at a big PR firm. We do, we talk about you all the time. Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we were talking about... how... neat all of Lori's shoes are? And we were saying like, a lot of women look like unsteady horses when they wear high heels, but Lori has a sort of... regal... trot. Oh my god yes. You canter. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! / What the hell happened? We're havin' a friendly meal here! Ooh! I hate that word. That word is so sharp. It's like an electric sword, slashing everything in its path. I... I'm trying to walk a line here, I want to be fair to you and to him, y'know? Come on. Oh? Ohh... I... I made you out to be a hero. It won't happen again, I promise. W... What? Lori, look, I know-- Hey, Ted moved out, didn't he? I did that for you-- for us! And it wasn't easy. Okay, look. I've been getting stoned too much. I know that. I've been bumming around with Ted too much, I know that, too. Give me one more chance, I promise I can fix it. Lori, I love you too much, please give me one more chance. I know. Done. Man, right here in front of you. Look at these pecs. Man pecs. Look at the hair on my upper lip. Man hair. I just farted. Man fart. You won't have to. Trust me. I love you. Aw, sweetie, I love you so much! You won't be sorry, I swear. Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my hand. Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your boss' ass? That won't affect your workplace chemistry, will it? He's a bear. Wow, cool. No. That's inspiring. You've led a rich life. Things are great, actually. You know... Lori would hate me for saying this, but... she's told me how you are at the office, and... as one gentleman to another, I just wanna say I really hope you fucking get Lou Gehrig's disease. Well... that's good to hear. Okay. CONTINUED: Hey, Ted. Why? What's going on? What?! Holy shit! How? Just like in the movie. CONTINUED: Fuck! I can't... I'm with Lori. I'm already on probation here. I'm coming. This is one man to another. I don't really know you, but I'm trusting you. As a man. This is serious. Can I trust you? Okay. Thank you. I got ten minutes, where's Flash Gordon? I... thank you for saving every one of us. With you? Yes. Oh my god, yes. Not... recently, no. Holy shit. All these people need to be talked to. Italian. What's the special on Tuesdays? Chopped salad half price. Yeah--wait, whaddaya mean? Of course. Well yeah--why wouldn't they be? But why even bring that up-- Yeah, but why mention it? So why are we talking about it? Yes, let `em in. Right. Okay. Hey Johnny, I just had a great idea-- let's go get drunk and puke on cars from the overpass! Johnny, you gotta get over here man, I just tried this DMT all the kids are talkin' about, and I'm in trouble! I think I got sucked inside my chair! No no. No, I don't sing in front of people! Holy shit! / Ha! / Wow! / Etc. AAA! AAA!! Break his arm, Flash! Cut his arm off!! Sam, no! Get off him! Guy? What?? Yeah. Yeah, I don't feel good. Holy shit. Holy shit, oh my god! I gotta-- I gotta go! Shit! Lori... I... Lori! Lori wait! Can I please just explain-- I was gonna-- I was gonna stop in for like five minutes, and then Flash Gordon-- Lori... please. I love you. Fuck you! I don't want to talk to you! Do you know what just happened? Do you have any clue? My life just ended. Are you even listening to me?! Do you give any shred of a shit?! Jesus, Lori was right. I should have stopped hanging out with you a long time ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch movies with a teddy fucking bear. And because of that, I just lost the love of my life. I just... I gotta be on my own, Ted. I can't see you anymore. Who is it? Go away. JESUS-- What? You're un-fucking-believable, you know that? How stupid do you think I am? First of all, Lori would never go out with Rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her-- Get outta here. What? I'm acting like a cock? Huh? Oh, and you can? Oh, yeah? Is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life? You can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship! It works out so much better for you when you and I are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't it? You know... sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years old... and I wish I'd just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin. Teddy... Rux-fucking-pin. My dick is in the TV. So am I, man. I love you, too. There is no putting things right. She hates me. Ted, we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it CPR. It died. (SELF-CONSCIOUSLY EXTENDS Hi. Hi, Norah Jones. Yes ma'am. Thank you for the opportunity, Ms.-- Ma'am Jones. Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins. Because I love her. This song always reminds me of the most important night of my life. The night we met. It's the theme song from the movie ""Octopussy."" SO HOLD ON TIGHT / LET THE FLIGHT BEGIN... CONTINUED: Lori! What-- what are you doing here? Good, good. I've, uh... made myself a nice little home at the Midtown Hotel up the street. I'd show you around, but it's kinda classy. They require an undershirt and at least one visible cold sore for all customers. Uh, yeah. How's Rex? Oh. Good. Well... I guess we can't make small talk all day, so I'll say what I wanna say. I could sit here and tell you I'm sorry, it was a huge misunderstanding, and I'm ready to change. But I don't think you wanna hear any of that crap. I'm not gonna try and get you to take me back. Why would you? I've been a really shitty boyfriend for the last four years. I don't deserve you. I didn't take our relationship seriously, even though I love you more than life itself. All I want is... just to end on good terms. Because I owe that to you. I want you to be happy... and for us to be friends. Well. That's pretty much it. Hey. Oh, I'll be okay. If I get raped, it'll be my fault with what I'm wearing. Go ahead. Whoever this is, it's not a good time. Ted? What do you mean, what kinda trouble? What? Wait, slow down! Where are you? Ted? Ted? Hello? Ted! I don't know. I don't know, but he's in trouble. CONTINUED: No, it's blocked-- wait a second. It's this creepy fucked-up guy who wants Ted for his creepy fucked-up son. They got him somehow. LORI Which way? Shoot up 99! Hello, 911? I need the police right away! This guy took my teddy bear! ...Hello? Whoa whoa, stop stop stop! Come on, we're losing him! Get closer! Easy... EASY-- Yes! Fuckin' A right! Sorry, someone had to go Joan Crawford on that kid. Come on! Oh Jesus... Stay here. STAY THERE!! Ted! Lori, get the stuffing! Get it all! You're gonna be okay, buddy. you understand? You're gonna be fine. No, look at me, buddy. I promise, you're gonna be okay. What is it? Just try. Please. Just try. Ted! Oh my god! You're back! You asshole! It... it was you. You did it. (cover wish. Oh my god, do you know how awesome it was punching a kid? I felt so powerful! I mean if that's what it's like to hit a woman, watch out, I liked it. I love you, too. And, I want you to know that... I'm probably never gonna be any more than a guy who rents cars, but... I don't care. You're the only thing that matters in my life. You and Ted. And after last night, I... I don't ever want to lose anyone who matters to me ever again. I'm not gonna wait any longer for my life to start. Lori... will you marry me? "
